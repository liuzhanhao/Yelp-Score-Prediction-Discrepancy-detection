truthful,"If I go back to Lee, I would only order the slaw again. The decor and ambiance in the main dining area are  Asian-inspired, as expected but also appears somewhat dated.   1) Singaporean-style slaw  We ordered Chef Susur's famous signature dish, the Singaporean-style slaw ($20) and added tuna sashimi ($10). This slaw was very good. There are so many ingredients but they work well together and it was refreshing and light.   The tuna sashimi was smoked on the outside and it didn't really add any flavour so I would probably skip that. The tuna does add a contrasting texture to the crunchy slaw. I arrived hungry and felt full after eating half of this dish.  Note: there are peanuts.   2) Peking & Char Sui Duck ($29): Beijing duck garnish, steamed pancake, foie gras p√¢t√©  This is not the same as what you would expect from a traditional Chinese restaurant style Peking duck. I didn't enjoy this very much.   3) Warm Molten Chocolate Cake ($12): caramelized jackfruit & banana, vanilla bean ice cream  Nothing unique about this dessert but it was delicious anyway."
truthful,"For the price, the lunch specials are well worth it. Lunch specials are on until 3pm.   We ordered some specials like ma-po tofu, General Tsao chicken and corn/fish on rice. All were priced between $5-6.   The portions were good. My ma-po tofu was big enough to split into 2 meals. The staff was friendly but did get one of our orders wrong. To be fair we did have a group of 12.   The restaurant is small but has 2 large round tables and a few smaller tables. The plaza doesn't have too much parking but the plaza isn't usually packed so we didn't have troubles finding a spot (but we did go on a Sunday).   We'll come back because of the price and location."
truthful,The nduja sausage pizza was very good. The thin crust was not too crispy and not too soft.   Another favourite was the anchovie pizza but I wish there were more anchovies.   The calamari appetizer was great for sharing for 2-3 people.
truthful,Customizable level of spiciness and niceness. Even a mild level of spice may be too much for someone who can't take much heat. Ask for additional noodles at no charge.  Can only pay by debit with minimum $20 purchase.  The lamb noodle bowl was ok. The lamb smell wasn't that strong.
truthful,"A new grab 'n go sushi shop. Regular price: $3.99 for small boxes, 5.99 for large. Grand opening special, 40% off. Just opened this week so not too much variety yet but regular prices are better than other sushi joints. Quality is good so far from what I can tell. The ratio of rice to fish is fair. It's too early to make any concluding thoughts but will be back to get a quick bite."
truthful,I thought the pho here was ok. I came on a recommendation but didn't find the broth a standout. I did notice that it was empty at dinner time on a weeknight but filled up when we finished around 9pm.
truthful,Pricing seems standard for Chinatown:  Monday - Friday* 9pm - 4pm (*Except holidays) Dim Sum Special $2.00/dish  Monday - Friday: 4pm - close Saturday - Sunday & Holiday (S) $2.38 (M) $3.28 (L) $3.68  Overall: The dishes were all as expected. Nothing too greasy or too dry. Went on a weeknight and it was mostly empty. They charge for tea but it's fine given the price of the dishes.
truthful,"I've been twice and was glad that the food was good both times. The prices are decent for the entertainment district and the quality of the food.   The zucchini fritti was good but a bit too oily.   Arancini came in 3s and it was nice for sharing. Not a must try though.  The prosciutto pizza was good. The crust was very thin so if you like thin crust, you may enjoy this.  Overall, pleasantly surprised and would prefer to come here over some of the other ""nice"" restaurants in the area."
truthful,1. Maki set The maki sets contain large rolls but the rolls are similar so it almost feels like you ordered one type of roll.   2. Sashimi boat - Each piece was thick and evenly sliced   Service Great staff   Decor There are individual rooms with curtains or tables in the main dining area.   They take reservations but we've never had to wait. The location is not the best but there is lots of parking.
truthful,"Service was rushed and the staff didn't clear the plates often so the table was full of piles of plates. This was towards the end of the night with an hour left of service.   Last call was at 10 and the staff was turning down the restaurant even though closing is at 11.   The food was ok. Some special rolls were interesting but the menu was about the same in quality and selection as other AYCE places.   Overall, not a great experience and would not return."
truthful,"Went on a Tuesday night at around 7:30pm. It was pretty full. Only a couple tables available (one was for a large group, one 2-person table). There are a few counter seats for single diners.   1. Ma Po Tofu - $6.95 Very spicy. No ground beef like most places. Lots of chilli oil. Good but wish it had meat in it.   2. Pork intestine, hand pulled noodle  A small bowl had quite a lot of noodles. Not mushy noodles, firm texture. Pork intestine was a nice balance. Broth was flavorful but not too salty."
truthful,"1. Coconut chicken soup ($9.95): coconut milk, lemongrass, ginger, chicken, mushroom - Strong lemongrass flavour, very thin and watery consistency  2. Pad Thai ($10.45) - Saucy and sweet"
truthful,"Decent Indian food. Not incredible, but not bad, either.  I usually go for the lunch buffet ($8.95/person) since shelling out $50+ for a decent dinner for two doesn't give me the food for value I can get elsewhere in town.  As someone else mentioned, they have a late-night 1/2 off deal, but unless you want to eat dinner around midnight, it doesn't make too much sense.  Nothing stands out in my mind as a ""must have"" or ""to die for"".... But, on the flip side, nothing is a ""must miss"", either."
truthful,"This place has been around for decades. And Coraopolis is full of Italians from the homeland. However, I don't know any of them that eat here regularly.  After the place was featured in Diners, Dives & Drive Ins, I figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I won't make that same mistake again. The sauce was oily (as was shown in the episode) and bland and noodles were tasteless. Home made? Maybe. But not the way I do it. It wasn't the worst Italian I've ever had, buy definitely not up to Pittsburgh Italian standards.  How anyone could rate this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me."
truthful,"Love this place. Best new bar/restaurant in the area. Limited, but excellent, on tap beer list. Food is solid. Good vibe. If you haven't been, definitely give it a try. Similar to Good Fellas on Mt. Nebo Rd. acros the river."
truthful,"Another one of my favorites in the Burgh. Kaya has been around for quite a while and it used to be a refueling stop for me on Christmas Eve before diving in with the shopping masses on Penn Avenue.  Their specialty, tropas, tropical tapas, were here way before Ibiza and all of the other tapas bars in town caught on with the idea of serving little dishes. Although, the tropas menu has been substantially reduced from Kaya's glory days, there are still some tasty treats on the menu.   The tuna tataki (or whatever it's called) - sashimi tuna, seaweed, sesame seed, all chopped up and marinated in a soy-based sauce, served cold and with some crackers is great. I also like the conch fritters; and the tofu cracklins - deep fried tofu served with a sweet, chipotle sauce (a little too sweet and not spicy enough for me - nowhere near the heat of mapo doufu - but it is good nevertheless).  I have never tried any of their main dishes...so I can't comment on them. It's usually 3-4 tropas between me and the mrs."
truthful,"I rarely give out 5 stars. It has to be incredible food and drinks or something so new and delicious that nothing else compares. With that being said, the Naked Grape was very good time, the place is intimate (maybe 10 tables total?), and also has a decent wine list for the Burgh.  The food was fresh and good, although portions were a tad on the small side, so we ended up sharing plates like a tapas bar and kept ordering until we were full. I would definitely go back for more.   As others have mentioned, you can sit and eat at the bar, which is not a typical bar used to serve customers drinks before they are seated - it is definitely meant for dining and you can even reserve seats at the bar.  The owners, who were inspired to open the place after a few trips to Italy, were working that night and service was pleasant and attentive. It is a hidden gem and not your typical restaurant in the Burgh."
truthful,"Best burger in the O.P. hands down! Fire alarm burger mmmm.....it's in the old Wayne's Lounge / Mutzig's building for yinz old timers.  Hand made chips, fries, and burgers - always fresh never frozen."
truthful,"Excellent dry-aged beef. You won' find a better one in town. And you will pay dearly for it.  Similar in atmosphere and menu to Morton's, the Capital Grille is located on the ground floor of the former Lazarus building at the corner of Wood & Fifth.  Expect dark paneled wood, a massively overpriced (300% and up) wine list, and oil paintings of Pittsburgh's forefathers (including Mr. Rogers).  The little things, like impeccable service by the bartenders, and umbrellas to your car on rainy nights by the valet staff, are refereshing.   Regarding the food - appetizers were just ok. I'd give a big thumbs up to the any of the dry aged steaks (simple and delicious and the house speciality) and a thumbs down to the Filet Oscar (Filet Mignon topped with lump crabmeat and a bearnaise sauce).  Also, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries (if you like truffles) - these are to die for. Desserts are nothing special - I'd give a pass on the key lime pie.   When I go back, it's straight to the dry aged steak and truffle fries for me."
truthful,"One of my favorite places for breakfast in the area.  No frills, Mancini toast, reasonable prices (like $4 to $7 per person)  If you are really hungry, try the 3-egg scramble (3 scrambled eggs mixed with grilled onions, peppers, sliced italian sausage, and melted cheddar cheese) - with Mancini toast (and butter). If you finish all of it, you probably won't need to eat again until dinner.  The 2 & 3 egg combos are also good. Sandwiches for lunch are not bad, but breakfast is definitely a better call."
truthful,"Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the ""unspoken house rules"":   1. Order first (do not try and sit down). 2. Wait for your food while standing. 3. Find a seat (if one is available).  Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.  My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.  Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: ""you can either sit there or there"", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the ""unwritten rules"" to us.  An ""excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down"" would have sufficed.  So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money."
truthful,"If you love well done burgers, then this is the place for you. Also, if you love homemade potato chips instead of fries.... Me not so much.  Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad. The five alarm burger is nicely spiced. But forgot asking for med rare or medium burgers. You're getting well done like it or not."
truthful,"Let me preface this by saying I love sushi. Nobu Matsuhisa and Kazunori Nozawa are two guys I used to visit frequently in LA for the good stuff.  I mean the really really good stuff. Andy's Sushi Bar ain't in the same galaxy.  However, I must say, Andy is the man. How can you go wrong with a take-out only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town (Wholey's)? Especially in a town like Pittsburgh which doesn't come to mind when you think fresh sushi.  I've had my fair share of nasty fish around town. Even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better (and fresher) than it was. Then I found Andy. No frills, no bar, but hey, the fish is as fresh as you're gonna get in these parts of the USA.  People seem to line-up for his endless list of rolls - and there are plenty. I never got why someone would order a Fried Chicken Roll. Personally, I prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi (whatever is fresh that day....usually yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel), as well as eight pieces of some roll Andy throws together in front of you - like a spicy California Roll or Salmon and Cucumber Roll. You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.  And one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up.   There is also a decent sized dining room upstairs (paper covered tables) that you can eat in if you don't want to take the food to go."
truthful,"Great place in da Burgh! Took the whole family. Sushi, yellowtail collar, salmon udon, mmmmmmm. Stay away from the wings..... but a great place on a warm summer night. Love it!"
truthful,"The best coffeehouse in the Burgh, hands down.  If you love Starbucks, stay away. The is not your run of the mill same old, same old coffee chain ala Starbucks, Caribou, Crazy Mocha, etc. etc. tt is the one and only and it shows.  It took more than a year to renovate this South Side loft into a very comfortable and neighborhood feeling coffeehouse and you can tell down to the minute details. From the real fireplace (I am sitting next to as I type) to the handmade coffee bar when you first walk in, Big Dog is something better experienced than described.  Everything is made fresh on premises, including the pastries and soups. If you are in the area and looking for a really good cup of coffee or my personal favorite - Mocha Bianca - stop in. You won't be disappointed."
truthful,This place has been sold once sold twice sold sold sold. And the food has going more downhill than Kyle Rasmussen at Incline Village circa 1982..... give it a pass.
truthful,"Without question, the best, and most authentic, Mexican restaurant in town. We're not talking Mexico City Mexican, we're talking Baja California Mexican.  The menu is quite simple and the food is awesome. The margaritas are small, potent, and pricey - but worth it.  My favorite dishes include: the shrimp cocktail appetizer with chips (good for sharing), and the mahi-mahi fish tacos. The burritos are huge and also recommended - try the surf n turf, wet (red sauce). It is enough for 2 to share (especially if you have starters).  No reservations are accepted, so if you go on a Fri or Sat night, be prepared to have a few cocktails at the bar.  Also, if you are a fan of chains like Mad Mex or Don Pablos, I wouldn't recommend trying Azul. You will come out of this place saying the prices are too high and the portions are too small.   If you prefer quality over quantity, Azul cannot be beat (unless you fly to LA or head south of the border)."
truthful,"Never...Never....Never consider this dealership sales department.  They should be working at a used car lot in the boondocks.  Run for the hills!  I honestly believe we were racially profiled and gender profiled.  They don't respect customers who just want the ""bottom line"".  They want to play patty cake and pretend it is negotiations.  It is plastered all over their wall, (literally) painted that they respect their customers.  I guess if you see and read something everyday you actually believe you are demonstrating those values.  SOOO NOT TRUE!  Find another dealership where they respect the intelligence of women and others.  Oh yeah,  they tried to keep us at the dealership, by pretending that we had taken the keys to the test drive vehicle.............HILARIOUS!    Only thing I can say is that Ruben in service is very committed to customer service.  He has gone above and beyond to help my daughter.  Maybe he can teach the guys in the front about ethics."
truthful,"Typically I purchase my gear at Nordstrom. While in Vegas for a business meeting I needed a pair of jeans. It was nice to see an AG stand alone store. Staff was extremely helpful and efficient. Go see Aubree, she was a huge help!!"
truthful,"One of the most wonderful hidden gems in all of Europe.  You'd almost miss it (we stumbled upon it accidentally.)  The owner is extremely welcoming and friendly, and will discuss wines and offer tastings.  The small bites and apps are amazing.  They'll also ship wine internationally, in case you fall in love with their own label from their winery nearby."
truthful,"I have shopped here since 1998 when I got back into keeping tropical fish in a live plant environment. after a few year's off.  I like that incoming livestock are kept in quarantine after arriving, that I can ask to be told when a particular species becomes available, that the staff are so knowledgeable and enjoy discussing the hobby, even though I notice some impatient shoppers just wanting to grab and go.   Reminds me of the now closed Pirrhana on Avenue Road that was run by a hobbyist, or Fintastic in the east end run by Mike.  Harold the head guy has saved a couple ailing fish with clear advice.  Just in case this seems too high a rating, keep in mind that I have seen a lot of fish shops since I began the hobby sixty years ago.  And plant and fish prices seem as fair as elsewhere."
truthful,"Here sushi equates to much ice-cold rice with very skimpy bits of fish on top. Had to ask waitress for wasabi and ginger and given inadequate amount. Salad floating in dressing, bland miso soup.  Slow service.  A year or two ago one could get a decent lunch here."
truthful,"Creative cooking. Modern cool joint with pleasant staff.   Loved the soft small gnocchi with 'nduja- though I found only a tiny morsel of this delicacy in the savoury sauce- and my friend enjoyed the Ontario perch which is difficult to cook well. Asparagus side imaginatively broiled and seasoned, al dente very yummy.  Overall very good food and a fresh approach though 25% overpriced on many items , the perpetual problem of focusing on decor that costs $$$ to build in.  Give it a try, I will return despite the cost issue."
truthful,"I am very pleased to have found this restaurant which is several cuts above other pho joints I have eaten in in the past thirty years.   It starts with brilliant pho broth: here is a very complex , low salt highly complex broth . It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago. Anyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.  I tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.  My bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.  Overall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour.   So I will go again though it puzzles me to see some negative reviewers dissing this place for another pho joint nearby. Guys, stay out of the commercial rivalry and avoid negativity! Life's too short."
truthful,"What makes a really goog neighborhood joint? For me it's not just quality cooking and decent prices- it's the sense of being welcomed and appreciated.  I have been dropping by for lunch three or four days a month often with a friend since the current owners remodeled the former Tokyo Sushi opposite  St, Paul's Chuch (where Tafelmusik plays).  The food decor and atmosphere have stepped up greatly. I have tried many items but my fave is the Chef Combi with salmon teriyaki and sushi. it includes generous sashimi as well. Many veggie items too.  Only a light dinner needed after such a feast.  No friend has ever disliked Maido and my friends are  Mostly picky foodies.   Anyway, it's my kind of low-key friendly place, give it a try."
truthful,"Having read raves I decided to eat at Sea Witch on a quiet Lunch hour.  There was  only  one other diner and about five staff.  No big deal being served , right?  Not that there was much effort to break off conversation and speak to me as I waited for a welcome. Finally ordered and having confirmed with the pleasant cashier that yes I would like tartar sauce, I was then asked by two different servers if I happened to want tartar sauce.   It seems that the staff don't pay much attention.   I told the last one that I had been asked twice already and received no reply, though in the end the sauce was supplied.  Pacific haddock was tasty but more batter than fish and the chips were lukewarm, far from piping hot as they need to be for taste and texture.  Slackness kills reputations, the decor and concept are good but the execution left much to be desired."
truthful,"Pleasant staff, decent food and fair prices, yet what might have been a perfect brunch on a warm summer Sunday today  was considerably diminished by many wasps swarming the patio tables.  I was told the owners refuses to use wasp traps or even one of the effective fake wasp gadgets that keeps wasps away. It's not even an expensive fix to protect diners so what's going on here?  It's a matter of time before someone gets stung and sues for damages.  Too bad, but shows a lack of care for customers!!  I down rated the place by two stars for that reason."
truthful,"I don't understand why this restaurant has such bad reviews. I live next door so I pick up food fairly often. Everything I've tried has been really tasty. (General Tao, shrimp in lobster sauce, noodles, sushi...)"
truthful,"Great food at a great price!  I had brunch there and got 2 eggs, plantains, beans, half an avocado, cheese, and a chicken tamale. I asked for scrambled eggs and to my surprise they added tomatoes and peppers. Everything tasted great! It's a good change from the regular brunch staples."
truthful,WAYYYYY too much hype about this place!! Seriously though... No seriously.   Only good thing about this place is how they are good at making the portions look decent in the photos lol  Service:  the waitress was no offense an airhead she was so distracted looking around at people seemed to have a bad case of ADHD  She knew nothing about her drinks list or about the food ... Was gone when we kept trying to order more food (we had to order with the bar back because she took so long to show up)    FOOD:  Tater tots :  meh not worth it  Cauliflower app: meh over cooked and nothing special  Corn bread: alright but really not worth it .... Unless you are feeding tweety bird.    Kentucky handshake sandwich: not worth the price (it's literally Kentucky fried chicken ... Like might as well go there and pay $6 instead of basically $15 to look at some arm ) lol   Chicken and Waffles : portion is not worth it flavor was alright nothing mind blowing (go to the Kensington market one ... WAYYY better and much more for your money)    Red Funnel cake : save your money .... Tiny over cooked and completely over drizzled with icing ... Yuck  worst thing I have ever had in the funnel cake department.   We ordered more food but honestly don't waste your time ... Just go somewhere else.... Not worth even going on about how bad it was.
truthful,"Service was really great fast quick friendly but the food was a terrible.....   Blanco roll was the worst..  it's like someone squished egg, tuna from a can and panko crumbs and made it a roll.... As if that's not bad enough they make it resemble some back ally hotdog by adding pickled jalape√±o to it.... Gross if you like fish cakes and hotdogs this roll is for you. If not I highly recommend staying away.   If they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalape√±o over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here.   Volcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi.   The sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature.   Complimentary salad was small cute and good.   The miso soup was good.   Tea was average.   Ginger is really good here.  Wasabi is really weak here.    I hope the chef seriously considers the suggestion I made about the less sauce and torched raw jalape√±o.... Ja Bistro has mastered it and it's incredible.... Maybe the chef should check it out and see what I mean.   Would not recommend this place. Will not be coming back."
truthful,I was on the phone trying to order with Khao San Road for over 30 mins calling back over and over again. No one picked up. Called here they picked up on the third ring took my order and had it ready in 15mins with a smile on their faces.   ^ that is service worth  great job!   Will defiantly be coming here more often.
truthful,"Always great friendly service and fresh baked bread and desserts everyday.   Highly recommend the custard cakes they are the closest thing I have ever tried to the original Past√©is de Bel√©m in Lisboa    The rice flour cake is also really good and a good option for those whom do not like cake too sweet.    The bean cakes are great here too!  orange, almond, and a few others I have tried are all good.    Can't go wrong with Nova Era"
truthful,"-6 stars ...I have come here several times....   The staff is friendly. However, I feel they have not been properly trained in making the drinks they sell.   The coffee beans are good quality however, sometimes the load is packed to tight and the espresso comes out with a burnt taste. Other times in a latte it is either too over heated or comes out like a cappuccino.   In the simplest way put very inconsistent and not in anyway good.    Some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting (i.e. Small Almond croissant $4.20)    Today I ordered an Early Grey. The earl grey tea I had tasted moldy .... It also made me sick.... Which makes me question what type of hygiene they have there.     Will not be going back to this place ever .... They are a disgrace to cafes.    Tip* go to the Starbucks upstairs in the indigo or across the street... They are closer to what it should really taste like.... You will get the coffee, late, cappuccino or tea the way it should be done."
truthful,-5 stars literally saw the 'chef' lick her fingers over and over again while I waited for my orange juice. Then she started setting up people's dishes .... With her bare hands...Disgusting place... Extremely unsanitary!!!! After waiting 10mins to receive my orange juice while almost puking watching the levels of sanitation plummet more and more I was then presented with half a cup of juice. When I asked to upgrade to a full cup I was then told that's the only amount I can buy? Okay guess they don't want to make money.   Tip- save yourself the nausea go somewhere  else
truthful,"-5 stars!! Worst place ever. Don't bother going here you will definitely regret it.   Save your money for a better serviced, hygienic, more organized and professional establishment.    (You would think when a party of 40+ people are coming they would provide better service considering all the money you just brought into this dump for them)    No one from that birthday will ever be wasting our time making that mistake again."
truthful,Really small place to grab ice cream which is fine considering we have more cold weather than summer. The ladies who were making the cones were very pleasant and had great vibes... The person who was at the cash the first time I went seemed a bit stuck up but then the second time the front cash/ barista was also very pleasant and seemed to have very good vibes.... Hopefully I see more of this side the following visits too.    LOVE the cashew latte with the Brazilian blend  perfection !    Ice cream ($6 I would say they should be priced more at $4) was good quality for a soft serve.... It was defiantly not the same quality as McDonald's or an ice cream truck WAY better. The only similarity is that it melts quickly ... Like any other soft serve. The cones could be a little better quality because they do get pretty soggy at the end.    Love the creativity they have with the cones! I hope they continue to come up with new ideas.   Small suggestion on the cinnamon one... Maybe add some nuts ... The current topping just seems so plain jane compared to the other creative cones you have!   Definitely going back to try more flavours!
truthful,"All I have to say is .... if you're going to get a tattoo and want it done RIGHT and like no other place in toronto go see RAIDEL at adrenaline!!!!   I originally had an amaZing tattoo artist in Kensington (Vince) who unfortunately moved back to Venice, Italy. Fate brought me to the hands of the very talented RAIDEL!   His passion for creative designs and art is phenomenal! He has done quite a large AMAZING piece on me and most of it he just did FREEHAND  (That is talent!)    The thing I LOVE the MOST about his many talents is the fact that he has something that I find is SO RARE in a tattoo artist... he can create that FLOW into making your tattoo not look like a stamp ... but a part of you... an art that can even take previous pieces and make them one! I have about 1 3rd or fourth of my body tattooed and this tattoo SAVIOUR turned my several prior tattoo pieces (ribs, shoulders upper back) and with his new addition turned my body into a canvas with one solid flowing united piece. Brilliant engineer in designing.       Adrenaline is quite pricey ..but if you are getting it done with him IT'S WELL WORTH IT. If I wasn't so broke ass I would give him a HUGE TIP as appreciation for his VERY hard work and TALENT! I intend to repay him some day by surprise for the lack of the TIP he deserved that I didn't have at the time.   This HARD working FRIENDLY always smiling singing ARTIST will make you NEVER WANT to go anywhere else with all his talent and positive energy!"
truthful,"Quick very friendly service this evening! She was very welcoming and made some suggestions after knowing it was our first time.   Butter Chix- Creamy subtle kick of butter chicken spice... Saucy very enjoyable!    Mum's Chicken Pie - Classic  was not disappointed LOVE the touch of Chardonnay really gave it that extra little something   Traditional Aussie - Saucey , meaty, has a little potato (not too much... Which I really appreciate because I didn't have an allergic reaction to it from that very reason )   Surprisingly even though these little guys are the size of your palm they are actually decently filling ! ... You might just need 2-4 to fill you up depending on how much you can handle.   Price is okay ... About $7 each Palm sized pie. They have 4 pies for $24 to take home and cook located in the freezer ( I feel that is a better suited price for the cooked ones too)     On the plus size the hand held sizes lets you try more flavours!!   Would recommend people to check it out!"
truthful,The only good thing at this place is the friendly staff... The food however is ...terrible. Save your money. I don't know how someone can over cook rice into a mash! The curry was literally just curry no veggies or anything... And I felt like I was drinking curry soup that was much too creamy and not enough spice. Also had the Tom Yum Shrimp soup... Very disappointing it was literally some powder tasting broth with 3 shrimp and a couple mushroom slices... Not a traditional Tom Yum at all. If they had a -1 star I would have put it.
truthful,Customer service from both staff today was really great. So I ordered the matcha latte .... Drank it and my stomach turned it is really sweet! I don't mind sweet treats but when it comes to beverages I am only a fan of bitter and sour things.... They happily (literally with a smile) offered me another beverage. I felt pretty bad because I hate wasting but I just can not do sweet drinks.   FYI their matcha powder has sugar mixed into the packaging they get (just like Starbucks).... Which would be great ... Unless you are not looking for a sweet drink...    Great news! Their soy latte is amazing! Deep rich coffee bitter flavor (which I love). I was very pleased by how calm and positive they both were with me as I am sure that was probably annoying to have to waste the product  More coffee shops should have this type of professional positive smiling customer first type of employees    Location also has a fireplace which o imagine will be nice in the cold winter months. Washrooms are clean (probably because now they aren't bombarded with all the school children arroyos the area coming in and disrespectfully destroying it and leaving it messy every 30mins.
truthful,"Love love love Quantum Coffee  100% better then Starbucks (and done properly) Lattes, Cappuccinos and flats, Oh my!      Also a few cents cheaper then Starbucks(but WAY better in quality)!   Service is always great baked goods are always amazing and super fresh! (Also sent in from local bakeries )    Did I mention they now have a reward coffee card ? That's right Starbucks .... You have zippoooo on Quantum... Suck my kiss."
truthful,"LOVE the food here!   Always amazing friendly service. The atmosphere is good it's a very simple place inside out but the food is killer! I always come here when I need my Korean food fix!   The pork bone soup is awesome the meat basically falls of the bone! (Perfection)   The Bibimbap is always my go to dish! It tastes like the best mothers home cooked meal!   I love how they are always attentive to make sure you get your pickles and such at the beginning and how friendly and welcoming they are. Great place to go with a family, group, as a couple or alone!"
truthful,The fish taco is really good.   Burrito boys makes the best burritos this place... WAY too much bread ratio not enough of anything else.   The other meat tacos  not good meat tastes more like old leftovers from earlier that week. Lol gross.   TIP: if your going only get fish tacos
truthful,Authentic home made curries ...  Great Tom Yum   Pad Thai is good    Vibes are relaxed   Music not too loud   Fills up quick because it is a small Resturant.   Staff pleasant.
truthful,Several unfriendly / unhelpful staff. Unorganized. Will not be returning.   Went in to drop off a prescription staff was rude and when I insisted on leaving my account information she cut me off and told me she would get everything she needs when she contacts the other location to move my prescription over.    I return 2 days later (no phone call left to let me know they were filled). I get there and had to wait 30mins for this also unfriendly staff that seems to apparently hate her job to give me my prescription. Apparently it's too challenging for the staff to process a simple refill pickup.
truthful,Late review .... Wayne was amazing! Best massage therapist I have ever had hands down unfortunately I found out he no longer works here  now I need to find him
truthful,"Use to come here all the time and loved it!   Service needs a little work but more importantly lets get to the food reviews   Starting with my personal favorite...  Ravioli di Zio Paperone -Great  homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano  Tonnarelli alla Norcina - Good  Italian black truffle shavings, homemade spicy sausage, pecorino    Tagliatelle alla Bolognese- Great  traditional bolognese rag√π, parmigiano     Tonnarelli ai Funghi - Good  oyster and honey mushrooms, porcini sauce    Cavatelli al Ragu' D'Agnello -Great  handmade cavatelli, lamb braised in tomato sauce, Pecorino    Gnocchi alla Simi- Good  tomato sauce, fresh ricotta, basil, parmigiano    Rigatoni Arcobaleno - Good  mozzarella di bufala, zucchini, light cherry tomato sauce, basil    Agnolotti alla Lilli -Good  stuffed with spinach, ricotta and pecorino, butter, sage and parmigiano  Spaghetti in Canna a Mare - Okay  fresh clams and mussels, calamari, scallops and tiger shrimp, light tomato sauce     Apristomaco - Appetizers    Carpaccio di Manzo- Great  hand cut, raw beef tenderloin, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, parmigiano reggiano shavings, arugola   Funghi Assoluti - Good  basked oyster mushrooms, parmigian, bread crumbs, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, arugola   Frittura di Calamari - Okay deep fried lightly floured calamari  Tagliere del Salumiere -Good  selection of Italian and local cured meats  Tagliere di Formaggi - Good  selection of italian cheeses served with honey and homemade jam   Insalate - Salad   Only one I have tried is Caprese and it was Good.    Pizze - Pizza   They are well done thin crusts .... I personally like Napoli, Margherita, Bufalina, Quattro Stagioni, Santo Stefano, Da D√≥ a D√°, Smendozzata, Li Pecuri, and finally C't Mang.    Dessert ... I always get a flourless chocolate cake heated .... It's a perfect finish for my dinner with a cappuccino or latte"
truthful,"Desserts and bread are always great at Nova Era. Customer service is terrible.   Desserts always a great variety and always fresh.   Couple recommendations; custard cakes, bean cakes are all amazing!    Customer service.... After waiting in line for 15mins with only two people in front of me I was told to go to the other counter to order my sandwich.... After ignoring me for another 10mins the extremely rude woman making sandwiches doesn't even greet me and in a very unfriendly manner tells me to basically go sit down and now wait to be asked what I want.   20mins pass and I am still here sitting and waiting to have someone approach me to take an order. I will never be coming back here to eat and HIGHLY recommend only coming for the bakery stuff only here!    Terrible fucking service."
truthful,Performances are great but the crowd and music needs a little work. Also they shouldn't space out all the wicked performances sooooo far apart.
truthful,"""In cod we trust"" great deep fried fish toco (but fish portion is small)   ""Beef Cheek"" braised and good portion   Tuna Chive in hard shell toco okay portion ( a little too drenched in sauce)    We had some ribs ""special of the day"" portion not worth the price AT ALL ... Sauce is a type of honey garlic (drenched in mayo ) not worth the money.    I had high hopes for great food here after reading the reviews ...but was over all not really that impressed."
truthful,Chicken and waffles are awesome!   And that's about it folks   Don't bother with the pasta or hamburgers (was not impressed at all).    Friendly staff who seemed to disappear after giving us our food .... For a long while.....
truthful,This place is a hit and miss some times the food is really great and flavourful and other times I have ordered food that was over salted or just bland.   Service has been okay. Portions are a hit and miss for some things. I don't think I will be going back after my last visit though.
truthful,DO NOT GO HERE!!! If there was a minus 5 star I would have put that. Seriously they are gypsies here...you order sushi for take out.... They send you with some panko filled rice and drizzle oyster sauce to make it look like eel roll. Warning they use the WORST quality fish too!
truthful,"Love this place .... Honestly best Burrito in Toronto  Halibut is tasty, simple, flaky .... Brilliant"
truthful,"Not authentic at all..... NOT AT ALL   Khao Soi ..... Not sure who paid all these reviewers to call it ""authentic"" ... I am a HUGE fan of Thai food and have NEVER had coleslaw ... Yes that's right ... Literally COLESLAW in the Khao Soi. It is disgusting. Beef was not tenderized and undercooked.    Tom Yum - the only average thing worth maybe trying if there is nothing else open and you need food. It is heavy on the lemon grass and is missing the fundamental herbs and spices.... For starters galangal .... Had no freshness to the soup .... Tasted like over cooked boiled veggies that had some paste added  choice of meat and severed.     Curry is not authentic at all .... It is a pre-made paste added again to something cooked separate.... Then served. A paste at a Resturant considered to be authentic should be made in house and better quality.   Service was fast.   Servers were fine.   Music was fine.     Overall poor quality food.... Will not be coming back and DO NOT recommend this place to anyone."
truthful,"Awesome home cooked style food! What a little gem we found! The outside is a little off putting but once you go in its a completely different situation.  Service was great ! Friendly professional classy staff and great priced filling traditional food!    Cabbage rolls - saucy simple and tasty   Perigees- loved the potato ones!!   Schnitzel- tender, not oily, tasty    Very fresh ingredients ... Really satisfied our home cooked craving"
truthful,"Butter tarts really well done, they have a bourbon one that is also very good for the liquor lovers.  Chocolate and butter croissants very well done and properly texturized. Almond croissant was a bit on the drier side   Macaroons Matcha & white chocolate - had a strange fridge radiator after taste which I hated and the matcha was too mildly infused. Earl grey has a chocolate filling which is honestly, too overpowering for the bergamot notes. Red velvet also more chocolate in flavour not quite enough vanilla (maybe just the supplier).   Over all there were a few I did really enjoy and would recommend, as I would select the following flavours again upon my next visit  100% Salted Carmel then, Hazelnut, Pistachio (could be a little stronger but still amazing) , Lavender, Boston cream is very true to flavour, Raspberry, and Chocolate.   Honestly, the last time I came in but NOT the first three times ... but the last time .... all my macaroons had a really off putting stomach turning fridge taste. As it was the only time that happened I will he going back as I love the lavender and salted caramel macaroons !   Have yet to try the pies but they look fabulous along with the scones and meat pies.... can't try everything in one day ;)"
truthful,Great friendly service was provided they had a sale on so I went a little over board with the shopping and the staff was there to help me find my perfect sizes for everything I needed.
truthful,Staff taking orders in such a rush they mess up my order... Which I only find out 10 mins after watching the barista mess up my drink twice ... Which she claims 'someone must have taken'    Then to complete her customer service the barista then speaks to her coworker and makes me go BACK to the line to pay the extra $0.63 cents for the mistake they have made    What a joke where do they find these people? Never thought I would find such horrible people working at a coffee place as all my past experiences at many other coffee houses have been great.   Tip - save your money for a Timmy's or other coffee place in the hospital.
truthful,"I have been here before but my last experience was not good at all.    The bad - the younger lady who served us seemed like she does not like her job ... She made our visit unpleasant right from the entrance ... She seemed a little arrogant too.... And was not very familiar with the desserts.  I am not a fan of lemon desserts but I do not mind something with a tiny note of it (as I know a lot of baked desserts often do have a little in them) ... When I specifically asked for her recommendation she gave me an extremely lemony dessert. I also requested a no foam latte and she seemed to also miss that one as she handed me something that closely resembled a cappuccino.   I love the heart of this place ... It was actually a bit heart breaking with my last visit as I have come in several times throughout the past couple years and have not received this type of treatment.   The good- Love the desserts here I usually always grab a mix box of the traditional southern Italian almond and pistachio biscuits and am always very pleased with the texture, the flavour and the combination of them!  The bread here is amazing highly recommend you try anyone of them (I am sure you will love it! )   The coffee beans they use here are also very robust and strong which I love.   I try to ignore the treatment I got here last time .....because maybe she was just having a bad day and was taking it out on us .....but to be honest that's no excuse, ever ... And it will effect me to now go closer to Bathurst and collage to go get my almond pistachio fixes from more pleasant staff."
truthful,I really love the butternut squash soup here... It's one of the things that has always stayed consistent even after the change of hands after the owner passed away.     Curry Lamb Wrap - Good  Has a great spicy kick .... Perfect for winter and autumn days.   Chicken Wrap- Good  Chicken is tender and cooked simple but well. Can't go wrong with the chicken.   Steak Wrap- Usually great but last time was way over cooked... They need the cook to keep a closer eye on the meat to make sure it's still pink on the inside of the beef....   The fact that it was over cooked made me think maybe they downgraded the meat quality ? Regardless now I will only be going there for soup!
truthful,"Highly recommend this place if your looking for a dedicated, experienced, professional who really listens and goes above and beyond to get the job done! Everyone is extremely helpful positive and kind.    I started coming to Myodetox after my boyfriend always telling me about how his whole volleyball team loves Boris and his magical fixing hands. I was not disappointed!   At first I was going to Boris to help with tightness in my hamstrings, hips and shoulders. Results were often immediate and helped me achieve better form and dig deeper in my workouts.    After my car accident and suffering from some serious whiplash and  a terrible concussion Boris really dedicated his time to help me.   He informed me on what to expect with concussions and whiplash and how to overcome my daily obstacles while being rehabilitated   They do a lot of services here! It's like the one stop shop for anyone's needs! I have had Physio, massage, acupuncture, cupping, and even things on vestibular rehabilitation. The list really just keeps going.   I still have a long way to go but I have made some incredible progress which I owe all to Myodetox!   Through my experiences thus far I can honestly say Myodetox really will bring back the new you"
truthful,"Quick service ... Tasty flavourful food... the chicken kabob is great and tender, tandoori special gives you a nice mix and the beef kabob is also very flavourful and tasty.   Salad could use a little extra something something but is fresh ingredients at least for now.   Great place if you need a quick bite."
truthful,Suffocation best describes the services given at this location. The rep was sooooo annoying. She didn't even ask for what we were looking for and kept bringing us what she normally wears in sizes that aren't even our size it was like she was having a conversation with herself or something ..... Like every min she brought me something new to try on.... It made me feel frustrated annoyed nauseated and obviously did not want to buy anything ever from here again.   I will be going to the other locations from now on to get proper service.
truthful,Food is good. Fresh house made broth great flavour and not salty like most soups I have at restaurants... Fair price for quantity and quality of food. Beef Flank soup is really good here. Service was fast!
truthful,Pricy but really good waffles    Good chicken portion. Let's keep it like that don't turn into home of the brave portions!
truthful,"Great selection .... When in stock. They need to get people who understand the products that they sell... Came in several times and it was hard to find anyone on the third floor who could help me with anything really.    I'm pleased with Micheal's being in the area none the less. I just hope for future hires they consider always having at least one person who understands what they are selling.   The first time I went in for gold leaf paint no one was even around to help.... Out of all the floors I finally managed to find a representative on the third floor. Once I asked her where I could find it she asked me to wait because apparently she was the only person working and had 3 other people in front of me?! How can such a large store be so understaffed on a weekend morning I don't know.... I was very happy to see on my second visit that this has changed.  They now have many more reps working the floor ...unfortunately when I went to ask about some stain glass products again, I was not able to get the help I needed from the first representative.... I was however referred to Amanda (on the ground floor) who was able to answer my questions.  Service is definitely getting progressively better.      UPDATE***  Went back a couple more times since and they are definitely getting things more organized!    I have to say I really love all the 50% off coupons from this place! I don't go to any other places for art supplies anymore because of the amazing prices and they stock is unreal!"
truthful,Terrible service .... Terrible over cooked wings.   Literally was like eating dried out oil jerky ... Not sure how they are still in business.    Tip* save your time and money go somewhere else... Anywhere else will be better.
truthful,Love love love this place!    Tacos tacos    Firstly just need to say I put the habanero hot sauce on everything here to give it a little kick! ... If you love spice defiantly try it.  Also rule of thumb *squeeze* that lime on everything ! Tacos and in drinks .... Just go wild.   Shrimp tacos were juicy and great   Fish taco was great and flaky   They had a Trout taco day feature which was great (with a little lime and hot sauce)  Chicken and beef tacos had a decent amount of meat in them and were nicely cooked and shredded.   The Vegetarian option was surprisingly also very tasty and flavourful    Ceviche love the jalape√±o touch inside but fish and tomatoes needs to be chopped up more for better chip grabbing fun.    Margarita pitcher could use a little more lime less agave and more tequila.... Less sweetness and more pungent twist and kick in the mouth to go with those tasty tacos. (I just ordered extra tequila and added to my cup.... But I would say about 4 more shots in the pitcher would fix it)  Over all very great vibes...music is beautiful loud and upbeat. Friendly staff. Great place to go grab a bite laugh and enjoy a fun Latin vibes time
truthful,"Great, friendly, quick service.... The Red , yellow and green curries are great  creamy and has a nice flavour   Red - personal favorite we get this all the time.   Green - little spicier so not recommended for those who do not like spice   Yellow - good .. not spicy"
truthful,Love love love ! Great food! Really hits the taste buds of sea food lovers ...the best way!   have been here many a times .... Love how they change up a lot of the plates! Always a new adventure    (Summer nights)Lobster Bisque - creamy buttery not over salty just perfect!   (Summer nights)Scorpion Fish with Roasted Garlic Mash - Garlicy creamy perfect mash - Fish was flaky tender perfect ... Severed with a side of roasted crisp veggies.   (AIl year)personally love the smaller oysters ... I usually eat 12  just for me!   (Entering spring)Tuna Tartar -Fresh And Toasts were a perfect duo  (Autumn) Seared Tuna with a creamy broth was absolutely perfect and the long chip  Clam Chowder - Creamy perfection with a little potato
truthful,Was very displeased as a regular client of Khao San Road.   I have come here for a couple years... always in person.   The other day I tried to order take out I was trying to get through for over 30mins calling over and over and over again. I was EXTREMELY unhappy with the fact that I was pushing close to an HOUR with trying to order food. I called Northern Thai and they picked up the phone immediately.
truthful,"REALLY dry ribs, pulled pork tasted like watered down sauce was added after cooking.   Mac and cheese was creamy and good not over cooked   Slaw was good- just normal slaw   I honestly could not believe how dry my ribs were.... It was pretty heart breaking as I had been looking forward to going there just for that for sooooo long !   Brisket was cooked well ... For most of the pieces I got because again part of it was dry.   Tip***The sauces are good but they need to leave the ribs in for a longer cooking time seriously tho .... Please do.... Ribs are suppose to fall of the bone not be like jerky .... If I wanted jerky I wouldn't order ribs.   Customer service was great! Very friendly and helpful.   This place has a LOT of potential to go so far ... The major loss of stars for me was because when you are a bbq house that advertises ribs like that I expect them to know it is suppose to fall off the bone."
truthful,Great Japanese Cheesecake!! I loved it!!   The only thing they need to figure out is an effective way to get that line moving faster. It can be a very long wait ... Which makes the  whole experience negative for people.... Taking away from the enjoyment of the products.
truthful,"My dog is really nervous(shaking, hiding, an occasional growl) at the vet.  Other places I have been the technicians make a comment about her being scared, ask questions, then leave. At countryside the technician went out of her way to try to calm my dog. My dog even gave her kisses, which she has NEVER done in the 10 years I have been taking her to the vet. I wish I could recall her name, because she was excellent. Dr. Hoppe was wonderful and knowledgeable and made our visit quick and easy without trying to add any tests or procedures that weren't needed. Because my dog is so nervous she is often overlooked as being a good girl, so I appreciate the nice words that Dr. Hoppe said about her! The free hugs and kisses on the bill is also a nice touch. Thanks for the good experience!"
truthful,"The veggie burrito here is a staple in my diet. Great place, simple good food and nice people. The student deal is awesome."
truthful,"this is hands down one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to, not to mention vegetarian. food is great, people are great. I will be back."
truthful,"I was unfortunately very dissatisfied with my visit. After having been recommended by more than one person for their Thai food, the Pad Thai and Massaman dishes were bland and lacked many key ingredients. The Pad Thai was particularly sparse lacking leeks, raddish, and especially the bean sprouts....and it isn't Pad Thai without bean sprouts.  In short, isn't worth the wait or the hype."
truthful,"DO not use this company !   The ""owner"" is rude, obnoxious, self absorbed and if the lack of business is any reflection of the work they do (NO cars,  no repairs, not busy ever) - then that should tell you ** ALL ** you need to know.  Whenever you walk into a company and there is NOTHING going on - then you should be suspicious.  This guy needs a course in Customer Service - but it wont matter - doubt he will be open long enough.   DO NOT USE - don't subject yourself - PLENTY of other quality, caring, busy automotive repair places right nearby.   PASS THIS ONE OVER ....."
truthful,Best fried chicken I have ever had. We went for brunch and started with the fried green tomato BLT. It was so delicious and unique. Next I had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the plain fried chicken. We both agreed it was the best fried chicken ever. The cocktails were delicious and so were the mimosas. I wish we had saved room for desert! Service was excellent and I loved the ambience.
truthful,Best cocktails in Vegas. You can add a shot or double shot to any juice. I got the spicy mango with tequila based on recommendation from the bartender. It was life changing. Also tried the kiwi blast and monkey. Very strong drinks at a great price and amazing fresh flavors.
truthful,"We came here for brunch on a Monday.  Pretty tasty food!  Great selection of both brunch food, and regular dinner-type food.  The price was much better than I expected it to be for a Vegas buffet (around $24), and it included a free mimosa/bloody mary/champagne.  The decor is amazing, complete with great hanging glass installations in line with the rest of the Cosmopolitan hotel theme.    Definitely try out the desserts (especially the great selection of gelato, and the chocolate covered strawberries!) as well as the macaroni & cheese."
truthful,"Came here for lunch after a long night of partying.  I'm a huge fan of French food, and had definitely been craving it ever since I arrived at PH and saw that the Paris was next door.  Mon Ami Gabi definitely satisfied my craving!  A friend and I split the steak classique (steak with butter), and the quiche Lorraine.  So good!!!  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested.  The quiche Lorraine was delicious, but I was so full by the time I got around to eating it that I only had a few bites; what I did eat was perfectly balanced.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders as well.  I only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare... I would've been on that like white on rice!  Side note, the bread is served warm and crusty, the way it should be.  I wanted to eat the whole baguette myself, not to lie... but highly disappointing was the cold butter!   Definitely worth coming here for a meal that is nice, but not too nice (I'm looking at you, 16-course tasting menu at JG), when you're in Vegas."
truthful,"I want to like this place SO MUCH.  The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.    To be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would ""incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes""--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue ""fighting"".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here.   If this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere.   In short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group."
truthful,So noisy we could not have a conversation.   Asked to be moved.   There was a table available but not for us.   No accommodation made.  We left.  Won't return.
truthful,Love their food..I went for their mac and bacon dish and it was yummy....the butter chicken that my husband had was so good too. Would be nice to have more chicken in it but other than that the food rocked. Waitress was great and she looked busy since it was packed house when we came in on Tuesday night since it was wing night.
truthful,I heard raves about onion rings being so good. I was a bit disappointed when I tried their onion rings. It tastes ok...not terrible but no seasoning to it. I like the A.&W.'s onion rings the best. Crispy and firm at most A&W's. Peter's were simple and bland. Maybe a bit like back in the 50's?  The burger was ok; it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished. The good thing is the variety milkshake flavours. That was what I was into; but for me; the milkshakes didn't have enough of that dairy/ice cream flavour for me. It was good but not giving me a wow factor. It didn't taste like real ice cream shake to me. I won't rave about it but don't hate it there. It's not a place I would want to go as top thing to do when in the area. Food is decent though.
truthful,The food was good BUT the service was terrible. There was no spoon for my coffee; they ran out of spoons they said. The waitresses aren't too friendly either. They were busy with their cell; texting and I had to wait a while for my coffee to be refilled. I was pretty much ignored for most of the lunch. Won't go again due to poor services. Also my home fries were burnt/dry. Other than that..the egg Benedict was good.
truthful,"We went there with our 9 and 11 year old. We didn't feel too welcome at all by the manager because we bought our 2 girls with us who behaved very well and it felt too ""upper class"" to even go there with kids even if they are older. Not a place to go with kids even though kids are allowed.   The lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which I didn't like. The Alfredo pasta was flavourless. Not too good. Was disappointed that they had no pizza for a month when we went there.   The waitress was sweet. But the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines.   There was a sign when I came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats. That was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense.   Don't think I would go again because it felt like setting a foot in a stranger's house and felt awkward there. Food was good though but hard to enjoy myself."
truthful,My daughter and I are both picky about the sushi; she loves this place hands down so we only go here when the craving for sushi hits. The food is just amazing and delicious. My daughter often orders two plates of california rolls; her fave. Rice is good and food is just right. Not over or under cooked at all. I love their good prices; not even overpriced at all. :) The waitress was very sweet and nice. Hubs asked for extra pickled ginger and got that.
truthful,We live out of town and really just needed some place to watch our dog while we had lunch since it was too hot to leave him in the car. We decided to get him groomed and had a great experience. The staff was friendly and did a great job. The price was cheap compared to other places. They called when our dog was ready to be picked up and we told them we would be another 30 minutes until we could get there. That wasn't a problem!
truthful,This is a nice off-leash dog park. There are plenty of spots to sit while your pup plays. There's not a ton of shade which was fine for our visit in late October but I imagine it's miserable in the summer. The park is separated by weight. There was a third area not being used due to maintenance. My reviews is only 4/5 stars because it's kind of a small park. It certainly does the job though!
truthful,"Took our 2 dogs for grooming here. While the groomer was nice he did an awful job. He had burnt the side of one of my dogs necks. There was burn scabs For weeks afterwards. I let the groomer know, he apologized and said ill use a different Gaurd next time. We gave him another chance and this time the burn marks were even worse! He had two huge scabs on both sides of his neck. My dog was shaking the entire way home. I am not one to write reviews but had to in hopes that it might safe another dog having to go through this. I can't imagine how I'm gonna take him to another groomer, he's been traumatized."
truthful,"I have been successfully treated by Dr. Xiao for 2 very different conditions.  1) I suffered a CTD / RSI hand/wrist injury due to my profession.  Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.    Now, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.  2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.  Dr. Xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.  She used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatments.  She is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that I have ever met, and she truly loves her work.  I cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life."
truthful,"I had a vacant rental house with pet odor that a competitor carpet cleaner washed twice to eliminate the odor throughout all of the carpets.  Desperate not to have to do new carpeting, I found Spotless Carpet Care on the internet and called Steve.  He came over right away and knew exactly how to search for the problem spots using a black light (the prior cleaning company was not trained with this technique).  He found nothing on the surface, as the carpet had been previously washed but gave me a great deal to wash it on his own, as he had high confidence it would work.  When he came to clean, he was on time and very professional.  The cleaning was very thorough and brightened quite a bit, even after the previous cleanings.  I would definitely recommend him for pet owners or landlords that have to clean carpets after someone with pets leaves the property."
truthful,"I called Just-In Time on Monday to see if they could move a very large china buffet to Goodwill.  They were very professional and courteous and mentioned I could save some money with the Yelp Deal in place.  Robert and Rick, the crew, were very professional, on-time, and very efficient.  I was so impressed I wouldn't hesitate to use them again!  Thanks guys!"
truthful,"We woke up this morning and found out that our garage would not open and we could not lift it due to a broken spring.  Wayne came out 2 hrs later and saved the day!  He was professional, courteous, and honest.  The repair will help our original garage door last another 10 years or so.  Thanks Wayne!"
truthful,"I recently had an interior paint job of bedrooms, bathrooms, trim, and touch up done through a competitor.  The price seemed to float higher and higher, even though I thought we had reached an agreement on the work to be done.  Needless to say, it left a bad taste in my mouth and some of the touch up looked terrible.    I called David and he was incredibly helpful and sympathetic to my situation.  I bought a couple of gallons of paint and he made the most of the situation on a limited budget.  The house now looks fabulous and I will not hesitate to use him again!   Thanks David!"
truthful,I had two cars washed this week.  He washed one at home and the other at work.  He was prompt for both appointments and did an excellent job on both.  It was a great value and I will happily use him again.
truthful,"Dr. Andy, Dr. Patty, Dr. Jeff, and the entire team has dramatically improved my spinal alignment on a permanent basis.  Yes, I said permanent!  It's not just them, its their combination of great talent, compassion, and a top notch methodology (chiropractic biophysics).  I used to get migraine headaches 1-2x per month...other talented chiropractors would be able to alleviate the symptoms after onset, but then it would come back again in a few weeks.  Since treating at Pivonka Chiropractic,  I have had 2 in a year, and the severity has been much less than before.  I used to have swallowing problems...this has also all but disappeared.  My shoulders could not relax.  Now they do.  I was so impressed, I sent my entire family.    FYI: This form of chiropractic is not for those looking for a quick-fix!  It requires serious commitment, but I promise that the gain in your quality of life will be well worth it!"
truthful,So cute ceremony that Elvis sung & had the Bride & Groom dance for #raykiko Ramon & Makiko Owens
truthful,"The food is really good, try the beef enchiladas with hot sauce go set at the bar when the mariachies are playing drink a corona eat some chips and just enjoy yourself."
truthful,Never had better burgers before! My wife and I were looking for a place to have some dinner in Toronto's Fashion District. Going to Big Smoke Burger was the best decision we could ever make. I had the Big Smoke Burger which was simply awesome side by side with some very big and good tasting fried onion rings. My wife had the Chicken Burger with french fries. It was so delicious and the sauce was so tasty. We will definitely come back next time we are in Toronto.
truthful,"We are very happy to eat here. it is a great place for us to eat, and it is a traditional Chinese hot pot, perfect!!!"
truthful,"Not impressed.  I took my Cavalier King Charles in today and gave them specific instructions about shaving his belly and legs and giving him a trim on top.  Not only did they not trim his belly but it looks like they just washed him, put a scarf on his neck, and called it a day.  We will be seeking a different groomer in the future.  It's slightly cheaper than other groomers, but who cares if your dog doesn't look right?    Also, the shop seems a little haphazard in how it's run, dogs running around everywhere in a small space."
truthful,"Ordered my wife's birthday cake last minute and they worked with me to make it BEAUTIFUL!  Thank you, Freed's:)."
truthful,"My friends and I went into Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian for a late dinner and drinks.  The food was OK, our server was reasonably pleasant, but the night manager Matt Timms, when questioned about the cost of an item on our bill, was so off the charts rude- my friends and I will never come back!  Mr. Timms even went so far as to threaten to call my girlfriend's employer to make her look bad when he learned we were locals.  I've never seen someone lose their cool like that, especially not a manager.  There are many better options for restaurants within this casino.  Beware!"
truthful,"Spirit Airlines is the worst!  Hidden baggage fees, such as having to pay $50 for a carry-on.  This airline is poorly run and will nickel and dime you to death."
truthful,"Never again.  I've been to numerous chiropractors and I've never walked out in this kind of excruciating pain (I left in a neck brace!)  I communicated several times that it was hurting and he kept pushing.  There are better, more experienced chiropractors out there.  Don't make the same mistake I did."
truthful,Front Desk was rude and not helpful whatsoever. The rooms were small and when we got to our room there was pee in the toilet still. Would choose a different hotel if I was you.
truthful,"L'arriv√©e d'Adonis dans le Sud-Ouest a carr√©ment chang√© la donne. Le magasin est lumineux, les prix excellents compar√© √† tout ce qu'il y a autour. L'offre de parking gratuit nous rend aussi la vie facile. On aime."
truthful,"The worst stay I have ever had. I understand it is a cheap motel. With that being said; we ark for 1 room with one bed simple two night. We arrived and found they gave away that room. So they gave us an ""upgrade""we walk into a dirty room where the beds weren't made and towels left on the floor of the bathroom. So of corse we walk back to the front desk ask for a clean room. They gave us one just down the hall. As we lay on our bed we hear burn outs in the parking lot and now the building smells like burnt rubber. Mixed with the smoke and musty smell. I complained to the front desk and I was told I think the ""regulars"" are working on a car. At midnight mind you.  I look out side my window and they are tack welding and grinding out side. I will never stay here in my life and warn others."
truthful,"I took my kids here, because I was excited about their menu, and I was craving fish tacos, the crew at pub chip are awesome and the food was off the charts, my tacos were super fresh and my kids loved their food.  I plan to make many future visits."
truthful,Great selection of flavors. Everything I tried was tasty. The presentation was beautiful. Service was very quick considering the amount of work they put into some of the selections.
truthful,"Paul is simply the best. He could of installed a new water heater but instead, he figured out that the old one was not broken- and told me! I have rentals and sell real estate, Paul gets the plumbing referral!"
truthful,"Went in on a Sunday around 2pm and got care for within minutes. I had no appointment and there were quite a few people there. I got a mani/pedi. Overall, I am happy with my results and will definitely be returning. I love the prices :)"
truthful,"I love fat straw! I used to work at Forever 21 which is right across from fat straw and I used to stop by and grab something to drink before work and on my break. I recommend Cali girl and BFF if you like sweet things. For coffee, I recommend the vanillachino."
truthful,"I've been searching for a new hairstylist, since I recently moved from Hawaii to Arizona. I couldn't find any good salons/stylist in Arizona, but thankfully I found Becca here in Las Vegas. She did an amazing job on my hair. I'm so in love with the outcome. I will be back for sure in july!"
truthful,Eating breakfast at IHOP is a perfect way to start your day. They are having an All you can eat pancake special right now. I also love there red velvet and BM chocolate chip pancakes :)
truthful,"My friend and I went here for lunch today. We got seated right away.. Took about 10 minutes for us to be greeted by our waiter. I ordered the curry beef stew and a honey dew slush. The curry had a good taste, but it had literally 2 pieces of meat and the rest was potatoes. We were done eating and we were waiting for the check... About 15-20 minutes."
truthful,"I lived in Hawaii for 18 years and I am familiar with all of the local bbq foods. I enjoyed eating at this place because it reminds me so much of ""home"". I just wished that they made the kal-bi in bigger portions. Other than that, everything else is good."
truthful,I gotta give the place 2 stars because the staff is extremely nice. If that weren't the case I'd give this place 1 star because of their lack of knowledge.   I have a 2008 6.4L diesel and it calls for 15W-40 in hot AZ weather. Newer ford diesels call for 10W-30. I should've checked to see they put in the right oil but when my wrench light came on and read a p012f DTC I knew immediately they put too light of oil in.
truthful,"I got an oil change here a few months ago. When the car was ready they informed me that my AC was out, which I already knew. They told me my compressor was shot and quoted me $1000 to replace it. I left bummed out. I finally got around to getting my AC fixed this week. I took the car to my usual shop, Granite Reef Auto to check it out. They told me there was no belt around the compressor. Well, $100 later I have AC! How did Advanced Auto come to the conclusion that my compressor was bad? I can never trust them after that. I will never go there again. Granite Reef Auto is great! They saved me $900. Advanced Auto was ready to take my $1000 and replace my already working compresdor. Shame on them. Really bad business!"
truthful,"I got the Burrito Phorrito. It was not good. My kids got the Stir Fry. They said it was ok, but we all ordered the slow roasted brisket for our meat choice and it was almost completely all fat. Couldn't even finish my burrito due to all the nasty fatty brisket."
truthful,"Wow, walked in on a slow Sunday night. Sat at the bar for 8 minutes, there was nobody sitting near me, was totally ignored by the bartender. Got up and left. They would have easily made $50 from me. Worst service ever! I'll never go back."
truthful,"The place is kind of filthy. I tried it 4 or 5 times. The last time the barber didn't even finish the haircut and yanked the cover so that the hairs that she cut fell all over my clothes. The old guy was okay the first couple of times I went there, but there's no guarantee who you get and in any case you come out feeling like you need a shower urgently."
truthful,"Let me start off by saying this WAS my favorite Mexican spot in las Vegas. I drive from Southern Highlands just for the Pastor tacos! Usually I go late night but today I went in around 5 ish. Was greeted by the kitchen employees and when they asked what I wanted I nicely replied with ""I need a few minutes"". This man I never seen working there before said in Spanish a rude remark back to his coworkers about me saying I'm not ready yet. I was so offend, and he totally ruined my appetite so I left without ordering anything. Horrible experience for a loyal customer."
truthful,"Really really cool place!  I got the shrimp over noodles dish, and my friend got beef over cattle.  Everything is so fresh and the atmosphere is awesome!  I'll definitely be back very soon!"
truthful,"This place is pretty cool.  I had a great time playing dodgeball with my son.  The foam pit is fun, but kind of gross when I think about it.  Sweaty kids just dive into it and I know those foam blocks are just soaking it all in.  Lol.  Overall tho, pretty fun time.  Trampoline dodgeball is awesome!"
truthful,"Great haircut!  Great experience.  You just have to try it.  They spend more time massaging, oiling and relaxing you're scalp, face, neck an shoulders than the actual haircut itself... And it's great!"
truthful,This place was so cool looking!  Real dark with a moder/futuristic type feel with glowing blue lamps and crazy shaped decorations on the wall.  The Deluxe Burger was great and you get french fries in this little shopping car.  We got the 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 regular fries... great!  They even serve it with Fancy Sauce (Step Brothers reference.. but true story)!
truthful,"awesome looking theatre!  I love the way it's laid out.  We went to watch a ""Lead and Succeed"" business seminar and it was cool.  Food is really overpriced though."
truthful,Awesome place... Just upset they took my salmon salad off the menu.  No more fish at all and that's what I like to eat when I'm out.  Their cookies and acai berry drink are awesome!
truthful,Lady was nice and did a good job on my sons hair.  My son is 6 and can be a pain in the butt with clippers.  She was done in 10 minutes too!  Only reason it's not a 5 star is because its just a haircut.  No cleanup or gel or anything after.  No water or cool amenities.  Worth the $7.99 I paid after coupon.
truthful,"This place was awesome! I found out I had plantar fasciitis, which stinks since I have a 16 mile run to train for in November. Linda told me to come in and she'll take care of me. I was properly measured, asked a bunch of great questions and totally catered to. It was great. I got an awesome pair of new Nike running shoes that not only look really cool, but fit my feet perfectly. I also got an awesome set of running socks, inserts and a roller. They explained to me that I have tight calves, which can affect my feet the way it did. So, I got the roller to help break up the knots. I feel great and loved the experience. I'm not sure I'll ever just go to a Sports Authority again for sneakers. This was great!"
truthful,These guys are awesome!  I referred them over to my cousin who was having a hard time renting his home.  Brian V. got with him and totally took care of him.  He got him more than the asking price for the monthly rent and everything was handled with the best of care.  Totally recommend these guys and will continue to do so!
truthful,"Beautiful jewelery, great staff, great price.  They were so personal and took their time with me and got me very taken care of.  Totally recommend."
truthful,Amazing catering company!  Their lasagna and 3 layer cookies are just like my mom made when I was younger!  Awesome!
truthful,"Pretty cool place.  Because I checked in and got 15% off for doing so, I am switching my 4 star to a 5 star.  The food was great and I love places that give yelpers a deal!"
truthful,Get the green tacos!  Atmosphere is great!  I don't think ill ever bowl at an amc again!  Spoiled!
truthful,"This place was so much fun!  The band was absolutely amazing.  The ONLY reason they didn't get a 5th star, was because I asked the hostess a few days beforehand if there was dancing, and she said ""yes, the band is awesome and they move the tables out so people can dance.""  The band WAS definitely amazing, but everyone kind of just stood there and my wife wanted to dance on her bday.  Other than that.... awesome!"
truthful,Not a bad place.  Not a great place.  The price awards this a 4 star because it IS a really great value.  Churros and quesadillas were pretty awesome.
truthful,AccountingProse are amazing!  It's so good to meet a bookkeeper that actually understands 1) technology and 2) that the goal should always be to make things easier for the client... not for them.  My experience has been amazing so far and I'm so glad to have started with them!
truthful,Been coming here for years!  Russ is the man and his barbers are solid.  Haven't seen fades and service like this since NYC.  Great people.  Never leaving.
truthful,Really nice people.  The food is ok.  I thought it would be better.  Everyone's taste in Italian food is different though
truthful,"The people here are really nice.  We like coming here.  I wish they had a better ""health"" section.  It's pretty small."
truthful,"Really cool boxing gym.  Would have gotten 5 star if they had longer hours and better weekend hours.  Other than that... It's really clean, staff is cool and the classes and instructors are awesome!  If u don't wok out late at night... You'll find this place a 5 star"
truthful,"Wow... talk about the absolute WORST company I've ever tried to do business with.  It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.    I used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge.   However, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message.   Bottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up."
truthful,"Nice place. A lot of fruit options, which I like.  People have been there forever, too!"
truthful,nice place.  They had a great guitar player that we listened to while having a drink for my wife's birthday.
truthful,"pretty awesome place.  A lot to do and it's good for adults and kids.  My son, wife and I went to hang out with friends and had a blast.  Bowled the best game of my life!  130!! haha"
truthful,"Love this pizza!  Very close to the style back home in jersey!  People are cool, too!"
truthful,Went to dinner here w my wife for her bday.  Nice decor.  Food was pretty good.  Calamari was great.  Waitress was a little slow in service.  Overall... I'd go again.
truthful,"Great place!  Tickets include popcorn, pillow and blanket with waiters.  Wow!"
truthful,"wow!  such a beautiful place!  from the golf course to the bars and outside patio, it's great.  We went there for Infusioncon and it was awesome!"
truthful,This place has been my favorite restaurant for 10 years.  It's amazing!  I always get the Mediterranean Calamari and oysters on half shell... But truthfully... Everything is awesome!  5 star!  Highly recommend if u enjoy seafood!
truthful,"Came here with my 2 year old daughter for our first date last night.  Halfway through the movie she got tired ad wanted to go home and when the front desk saw us leave, she asked if everything was ok.  We old her what happened and she gave us 2 free passes to come back again!  Awesome!  Clean place, great seating!"
truthful,I've come here quite a few times.  Pretty cool place.
truthful,"pretty cool place.  kind of annoyed that we were told they'd lower the hoop for my 6 year old son, then when we got there they said they couldn't do it. Overall, still a cool place though."
truthful,Great time here!  So much to see!  The monkeys and giraffe where the best!
truthful,"I met the owners through facebook and got to hear what a lot of their fans/friends/clients say about them.  Everyone said amazing things, and I can believe it with how great my relationship with the owners has gone in the few short months I've known them.  We are definitely using them for our next move and are referring them to anybody we find!  Great recommendation!"
truthful,"Really nice people and clean, slick looking bank.  Making the switch from Chase wasn't as easy as we promised, but they did try to make up for it.  I recommend joining."
truthful,"Been going here for 3 years.  Great gym.  Other than a pool they have everything u need!  Because of the no pool, I was going to give them a 4 star.  However, because they give yelpers an awesome deal by awarding them with a free smoothie and tan if they check in... It will be a 5 star!"
truthful,Great cuts!  Vadim is really good.  Got me to come back!
truthful,This place is ok.  Cool atmosphere and the dishes taste pretty good.  Just a bit expensive for the portion size compared to other favorite places.
truthful,Dr J. is very passionate about her work and builds solid relationships with all her clients.  She's great at what she does and is very very reasonably priced.  Definitely recommend.
truthful,"This place is ok. With the had some fish items.  But ten again... I don't think they're known for their ""freshness"".  Most of the food just sits there for a while. It does taste pretty good tho."
truthful,"Mike came out and fixed our AC again!  A whole new problem occurred and he spent the time to not only fix the problem, but show up later in the day to make sure everything was still running as expected.  He adjusted a few more things and the AC is running great.  Thanks Cooler Tymes!"
truthful,"This is our place!  They just started all you can eat sushi, too!  Order the volcano roll!"
truthful,Pretty cool place.  A little hole in the wall bar.  Had a fun time with friends but we had to move tables because they were about to start trivia night.  Man those guys take that seriously.  It was packed with trivia people!!!
truthful,it was ok.  Got my gas and the people were a little rude.  But... it IS a gas station.
truthful,"Just had lunch here with my wife:  French onion soup - amazing!  Parisian Sandwich - 8 out of 10, crepe dessert with caramelized apples - 9 out of 10, atmosphere - very very cool!  Great date place!"
truthful,Seafood lunch red curry plate.  Awesome. Tiny little place but clean and comfortable atmosphere.  As soon as I walked in I smelled good food!  They have free wifi and waitress was really nice!
truthful,Pretty good!  Coconut shrimp and sesame chicken is awesome.  Crab puffs are great too.
truthful,"Amazing food!  I live Mexican food, but Puerto Rican food.... Wow!  Try the pernil and empanadas!  Malta Goya and flan was great too!  Definitely coming back with friends!"
truthful,Great place and cool staff!  Cool atmosphere too.  Always good to know another great downtown spot!  Sit at the food bar!  The cooks are so awesome to talk to and you always have people taking care of you!  Crab legs are amazing too!!!
truthful,These guys did a video for our wedding entrance a it was perfect!  Exactly what we wanted and they worked with us on price and schedule!  Totally recommend!  They're the best!
truthful,"Me and my son's favorite place!  Get the Ecuadorean tamales and seco de pollo!  Apple soda is great too!  PS:  Expect slower service, because it is TRULY mom and pop.  If you go in with this attitude, you'll really enjoy the experience.  If you want quick, timely servers that ask you how food is every 30 seconds, you may want to try Olive Garden or something."
truthful,"Great little atmosphere to work or meet with people.  I'm not a big coffee guy, so can't tell u if that's good or not.  But, I enjoyed it and the place just has a great feel to it!"
truthful,"I searched high and low for a good salon near me (even driving out to Glendale & Peoria) and found exactly what I was looking for at Chace Salon thorugh Christina.  Christina's the best, use her and you'll have no regrets!  You can simply explain what you want to her and she'll figure out how do cut and style so that it complements your features!  And the price is beyone reasonable for a great hair cut!"
truthful,"I had my big olde english sheepdog groomed here and they did a fine job and the price was on par with everyone else. Actually I think the price is about $10 more, but I'll pay the extra money because of the extra service this place provides.  I really appreciate that they have a pet taxi, bc of this service my dog gets a ride home for free (but we did tip the driver). Since I have a little child it's hard for me to bring my dog and pick him up on the days I would have time to pick him up, so the taxi is worth it for me. Bc of this service I can now drop off my dog before I go to work and my husband (on days he's caring for my daughter) can be home to let my dog inside. This is easier for me than having to bring my 100+ dog inside while holding my baby.  Shauna's is right next to Mountainside Fitness, it's right in Surprise so if you live in Surprise this place will be easy to get to.   I also thought the service was great too. I'll definitely be taking my dog back here the next time he needs to get groomed."
truthful,Best sandwiches I've had in a long time! And they'll deliver--if you fall in their small delivery zone-- 1 sandwich to you. This comes in handy for me while I'm at work and hungry!   I love the bread & their mayo. YUM! I usually order the beach club. No complaints from me!
truthful,"I joined this gym after leaving Fitness 1. This gym isn't perfect but is as close to perfect as I could ask for.   I like the long hours the gym provides for daycare. And daycare will change dirty diapers!!! And for the most part I really do like the gym daycare employees (except I had an experience where the daycare manager was extremely rude, but I forgave that one instance because I figured she was having a bad day).  I also enjoy the towel service. & The equipment is great. The classes seem great though I have yet to attend a class.   But I wish the gym would add free wifi for members to use while working out (so that I can watch netflix while working out), add some more channels to the equipment's tvs (I wish they would add e, bravo, mtv) and add a laundry shoot for towels inside the locker rooms. I even put in a request for the laundry shoot but Mountainside obviously just ignored my request.   I also wish this location & all other locations would have a water service that they provide in their Scottsdale location. It seems like the west valley is constantly getting the short end of the stick and this is another example of that isn't it? & might be wrong but I think the Scottsdale location also has better tv channels than the Surprise gym does.  But despite those gripes I'm still a fan. This is the best gym in Surprise."
truthful,"I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could. Because to me, this place isn't blow your socks off delicious! Instead it's just good enough.   Look, when I'm craving pho I'm glad I have a place close by to order from, however it's just not as good as I'm used to back home. I think my problem is it doesn't taste as authentic as I'm used to. This place to me seems like it's trying to be asian fusion (like Pei Wei or PF Changs) when I just want pho nothing fancy just pho.  Though I did think the spring rolls were awesome!!!  But nonetheless it does fulfil my cravings without me having to drive 45 minutes, so I'm happy about that!"
truthful,"I love it here!  But you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount you're paying.  The all you can eat is around $25 / person & everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).  Seoul Grill recently revised their menu, so there are more options for different meats. They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.  And remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.     I must say it's really nice not having to drive to Koreatown for a decent korean bbq place!  Oh and all the people who work here are so nice & helpful! I wish they would make a Seoul Grill in Surprise! We need a korean restaurant in Surprise!"
truthful,"I'm so glad I found this salon!!! After getting my hair burned last year & then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown.  But luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did!  I got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo.  I have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)  I also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)  Go here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English.   I believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid. And digital perm costs around $130"
truthful,"I'm always complaining about the lack of customer service in Arizona, but if you go to Pleasure Paradise Salon you will NOT have any customer service complaints!  Believe you me!  I also had the best massage by Kimber. I'm always having neck / upper back pain because of stress & taking care of a young baby but Kimber gave my upper back so much attention that I finally found relief in my back.   And everyone from was so nice! One stop shop for hair, body, & nail care!"
truthful,"Helen's was terrible.  I got magic straight at Helens I think I paid $150 ish and she did not know what she was doing.  & kept blaming me, and kind of made me feel stupid my korean was not on par with hers.    Then when I called to tell her it didn't come out she had me come in again.  Attempted it again but given she doesn't know what she's doing obviously it didn't come out.    She also laughed when I asked her to cut my white husband's hair.  Told me to go to a white salon.  I thought she was really rude.  Hair city is waaaaay better.  623) 847-0308  Hair city has on multiple occasions successfully straightened my hair (hair city did give me a funky hair cut once)"
truthful,"Best insurance agency! Specialiazed in auto, home, life & business insurance"
truthful,"Family owned , Mike and Kelly (owners) are both very nice and both know their stuff. It's nice going to a repair shop that I trust isn't taking advantage of me! And it's nice walking in and speaking to the owners. Great customer service!   Every time I go to one of those other repair shops they come up with a list of stuff to fix -- and when I check in with my father in law or friends they tell me those repairs are not necessary for my vehicles!  Go here and you can trust what Mike & Kelly say!"
truthful,I've been a member here for 4 or 5 years.  I only pay $9 / month and the gym had everything I need... that is until I had a baby.  Look you know what you're getting at this gym.  It's kind of a no frills but cheap gym that's clean enough. So it worked for me during these past years.  the daycare hours that the gym are ok but the daycare workers don't change a baby's dirty diapers and instead page the parent which is disruptive to a workout.  Also the daycare hours (for me) don't start early enough.  So I'm sad to say I'm going to be switching to another gym probably at the new year.    But I did enjoy working out at Fitness during the past 4/5 years.  And all the gym workers are so nice and quick to help out with any billing issues (of which I have had too many!).  So I am sad to be switching.  But need to so that I can work out around my & my baby's schedules.
truthful,Went here to celebrate my anniversary. Food was good. But not lick the bowl clean good.   For the amount of money we spent I think we could have done better. But the meal was fine. Service was great.   Dessert is to die for. Pound cake & chooclate fondue. Enough said!   I agree with other posters who suggest just going for dessert. The food isn't worth the price.
truthful,"This used to be my favorite nail salon in Surprise.  But I think they changed ownership (in fact I saw that they changed ownership-- at least that's what they're advertising in the Surprise weekly).    Anyway, I received a white tip pedi from a new tech (female).  She did not paint even  lines.  And when I looked at my toes the lines were a mess and did not match one another.  Some were lower, some were shorter.  It's hard to explain but  my toes did not resemble one another.  I asked if she could fix the lines.  And she had to redo the lines and still couldn't get it right.  Look, getting a pedicure is a service and I want it to look nice.  And the fact I'm paying extra for the white tip... I feel like they should get it right.  I've been getting pedicures for years and have never complained.    Anyway, it was obvious I wasn't happy, the manager(?) Kevin came and looked at my pedi and told me it looked fine to him.  They know me at this salon.  I think even if they thought I was imagining the concerns (which I was not) I think they should have had another tech redraw the lines or comp something to make me feel valued.  Instead they made me feel worthless as a customer by telling me there was nothing wrong.  So I got upset, passed on the manicure, paid for the pedicure and left.  I've been going to this nail salon for years, I think 2 years.  They know me at this salon.  And to question me when I'm upset about something just doesn't make me happy.    I'm not going back to this salon."
truthful,I've had 3 treatments so far from Sabrina and love it. Her prices are great & she's super nice & attentive to boot! Great customer service! She'll rearrange her schedule as much as she can to help accommodate my sometimes hectic schedule.   Sabrina's customer service is so much better than the other laser place I've been to.
truthful,"the girls who work here and provide the services such as waxes, or massages do a great job!  But the customer service from the girls at the front desk is awful. SO terrible I don't want to go here again. Like those girls are so snotty and rude. I'm unsure why they think that's how they should be doing their job."
truthful,Excellent service and experience all around. Sometimes you can tell the quality of a restaurant by how they handle the simplist things.  Their prime rib sandwich with au jus dip was perfect and tender. Highly recommend
truthful,"We have been going to Phoenix for sometime now, but only recently learned of Joes Farm Grill. We tried it out, and let me tell you, it was awesome. Their portions were just right, and even though I was full when we left, I didn't feel gross like I do at other restaurants. I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I loved it. Thin, flatbread crust made for a light pizza, very tasty pizza. My wife had the chicken Caesar salad. She gets that salad so often that she knows her Caesars, and she said this was her favorite dressing. And the chicken of course was amazing as well."
truthful,"I've been to see Dr. Tom Nguyen for the past few years.  He explains things clearly, he's friendly and is willing to take the time to answer questions.  He does the cleaning himself, which means that you get more time with your dentist.  The cleanings have always been free of any significant pain (as little discomfort as a trip to the dentist can be, anyway!).  He has never suggested any costly/unnecessary procedures (which I'd recently heard can happen), and I'm glad that he noticed some gum recession and suggested that I see a periodontist to prevent problems in the future.  Appointments have always been easy to get.  All in all, a great dentist!"
truthful,"Hirut is great.  Delicious food, friendly staff, a down-to-earth feel.  I couldn't ask for more.  It's my favourite Ethiopian place in town... I think partly because it doesn't feel like it is trying hard to be great; it just is.  I haven't been for any live events, but I love the idea that they do this."
truthful,"I am giving 4 stars for the coffee, otherwise it would only be three. My croissant tasted dry and as if it was made a few days ago. However, I could tell it was yummy. I find it very difficult to find a good cup of coffee out of my house and neighborhood, since we are spoiled in the Bay Area. Sure enough, they actually use a Bay Area roaster (Equator) and it was great and quite the relief!"
truthful,I rarely leave reviews. That being said I have to let the world know that Ciarra not only gave me the best facial I have ever had. She also managed to make me relax enough to enjoy it! I have a hard time relaxing. Her amazing personality put me right at ease. You can tell right off the get go she knows what she is doing and she is a beautiful person!
truthful,We ordered the 2 fish combo and fish burrito. I found the best idem to be their cocktail sauce. Over priced. Small portions.
truthful,We went there on our anniversary this year on December 6 th .I was concerned after reading the reviews from different sights .wow! We're we happy we ignored them . excellent service and the food was perfect Miriam( I think was our servers name ) and she was fantastic .I did feel the prices were high or should I say  higher than I want to pay .but the lady has put up with me for 48 yrs.so I think she deserved it .the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the prices .
truthful,What a great spot and atmosphere! Oh and their beer is some of the best AZ stuff around! Can't wait to day drink there.
truthful,"I am in love with this place. Today was my first time and we need one in Tucson immediately!   The parking lot was packed and just as I was about to get irritated I noticed there is complimentary valet service. Que  fancy!   The inside is super casual and clean and the staff was awesome! We didn't get to sit outside in the crazy cool and dog friendly patio. I saw a dog sitting on the a table outside!   I ordered from the $10 brunch menu. Food plus 10oz beer or mimosa. I had the breakfast wrap, the wife had the breakfast flat bread. I recommend both. My girls had chicken tenders which were actual chicken with a tasty fried covering. They loved their food too.   If you have kids, a dog, and hankering for good food you owe it to yourself to come here."
truthful,This place has 2 sandwiches cheese steak and cheese chicken! There are some small eats for kiddos but you owe it to yourself to stop here after a long IKEA hike. The bread is what seals the deal for me.  I had the chicken with cheese whiz and buffalo sauce. #nailedit!   The staff was also crazy nice! No five stars only because I thought they served other types of sandwiches too.
truthful,A must stop on your way back from Vegas!   I had the huevos rancheros with their signature green chili and pork. So good! The portion to price ratio was a nice return to normal coming from the land of a $10 beer on the strip 30 minutes away. The eggs were cooked just right and the pork green chili was smothered over the fried tortillas and beans. If you like green chili and solid breakfast food you have to take the very quick detour into the historic downtown area.   I'm sure there is a wait almost every weekend but that will give you some time to do some antiquing.   I'll definitely be going back!
truthful,"This theatre is the ultimate splurge!  From the comfy recliners complete with blanket and pillow (in the premium seating) to the fantastic wait staff you couldn't ask for a more luxurious way to watch a movie.  Being able to book online and have reserved seats is very convenient.  Yeah, it's expensive (total of $250 for premium seating and dinner for 5-no alcohol involved) but is worth it for a nice evening out with friends once in awhile!"
truthful,"Bought a used beetle at a dealer out of state and had a small problem with it on the way home.  Called San Tan VW service department the next day and was pleasantly surprised how friendly the people were on the phone.  I took the vehicle there the same day and was greeted by Jeff Aguilar in service who looked at the car and called me within the hour with the diagnosis.  The next day, the car was ready, fixed right and freshly washed. They even worked with the dealer in California that I bought the car from for payment.  I will be bringing the car back for regular maintenance without hesitation.  Thanks and keep up the good work!"
truthful,"Went tonight for a quick dinner which turned out to be over an hour.  Nice decor, very clean but the very slow service (40min wait for our entrees) was way too long.  Never saw the waitress again after we placed the order until it was time for the check.  When the food arrived, it was only lukewarm and despite my attempt to flag down a waiter to refill our drinks, we were basically ignored.  Can't see this place lasting any longer than the other places that have been it this location, will not return."
truthful,"Called Adam to tint my VW beetle.  He called back immediately with a quote and even beat the current Groupon price, plus he comes to you which made the deal even sweeter.  The car came out fantastic and he cleaned up all the overspray and left the car cleaner than it was.  Highly recommended! Thanks again Adam."
truthful,Kudos to Charlotte Motor Speedway!! They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!! Way to go CMS even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life!
truthful,I have eaten here quite a few times and the food is good. The 2 stars is because they no longer have limes!(trying to get a response) I ordered a margarita (ultimate which was very good) and when I asked for a lime the bartender said they had stopped ordering them because they were too expensive! Now granted this didn't make or break my meal but that was one of the strangest things I have heard. It wasn't like it was $2 margarita night ($9 to be exact) Hopefully someone in management will see this and respond. If you like a lime with your margarita or your Mexican beer you may want to pass until they they make a better business decision
truthful,We are regulars but tonight we tried Korean short ribs which were amazing!  If you haven't tried this place the sushi and everything else is so good!
truthful,Had the Lobster with pasta a la carte - $45ish.   It was the best pasta lobster dish I have ever had - period. I am Italian and have been eating homemade pasta for years.  This rivals my great-grandmothers cooking.
truthful,My midway nissan review. This place is not honest.  My experience with them is that they will not honor their commitment to you.  Don't shop here. They are liars!
truthful,First Choice provided Jesus and Gustavo. They were very professional and careful. Thanks Guys -- you were awesome!
truthful,Terrible customer service.  Was looking to buy an Evoque.  The salesman was totally arrogant  and the Sales Manager wouldn't budge on the quoted price even though I could get the same car in Scottsdale Az for 2K less.  I just wanted an extra 500 off - nothing crazy.  I was basically told that they know they are the only game in town - only Land Rover dealer for hundreds of miles and I was just going to have to take it or leave it.  After getting totally pissed and deciding that I'll just buy the car and get screwed on a bad deal they tell me that it is getting late (Saturday 4PM) and that even if I buy the car - right now - they can't delivery it to me today because they don't have enough time.  I'll have to wait till next week to get the car I am standing right in front of.  What!!!  What kind of low budget garbage is that?    I've never tried so hard to give someone 54K.  I'm done with these guys.  Taking my business and money somewhere else. What a joke.
truthful,"Food was good.  Prices were less than Jen's across the street and the meat portions were bigger.  We got 2 salad rolls and 2 orders of B6, beef, pork, chicken, and spingroll, with veggies.  Paid $35 after tip and left full!  Will be coming back!"
truthful,"Food came too quick, meatballs were still cold inside, jambalaya wasnt quite hot.  They forgot to ring in the appetizer  Service was ok, nothing more.  It was pasta tuesday, moderatly busy.  I like the deal on tuesday so we keep coming here hoping for improvement, so far it hasnt happened."
truthful,"Perfect job! We hired kaleidoscope to paint our entire house - baseboards, trim, doors, walls, ceilings. It looks awesome and perfect! And they finished early. We will definitely hire them again."
truthful,The vet took the time to explain what was possibly going on with my dog. Staff was friendly. Pricing was good. I will be going back for my vet needs in the future.
truthful,First time here and the ice cream was excellent and very cold due to that it's made by liquid nitrogen. I would give it 5 stars only if they had more seating. #MakeItSweet
truthful,First time here. Trying out a new Boba place and it's great! My first drink is Vietnamese coffee Boba milk tea...super good!
truthful,I went to see Dr. Steven Folkerth for a routine physical. The receptionist was unfriendly. The doctor gave me a prescription for blood tests and Vit D test.  I went to do the tests the same day. After waiting for about 2 weeks and I did not hear from Dr. Steven Folkerth about the result of my tests. I called his office and the receptionist said she has the result in. I went in to pick up a copy of the tests and the receptionist was still unfriendly. I saw that my triglycerides was above normal range and that the Vit D test was missing from the report. I asked the receptionist to locate my Vit D report and she said she is going to give me a call next day. I waited and she never call. I called her and she said she is going to get back to me. It has been 10 days since I talked to her and she never called me back. I am missing a vital part of the test because my Vit D level was low from a previous test. I understand Vit D is very important for my daily health. I got a run around. The doctor or the receptionist never contact me about my high triglycerides and missing test.  I am very disappointed from the people in this office.
truthful,"This by far THE best sushi in the valley. No joke, everything is to die for! The sushi chefs are amazing. I like to sit at the bar here even though I usually opt for a table elsewhere. Their menu of specialty rolls is a bit intimidating I admit but, just let them know what you like and they'll make excellent recommendations. I must say, the sauces are beyond anything I've ever tasted. If it were socially acceptable, I would pick up the plate and lick it clean. I'm not exaggerating, they're heavenly perfection and unlike no other. Please be aware there are no prices on the menu. Apparently it changes based on market fish prices and it can be a bit pricey. If I lived closer I'd be there all the time, seriously. No matter where you live, it's absolutely worth it!"
truthful,"Amazing! They have lunch specials everyday, not just M-F. The Sunshine Roll is pure heaven, in fact, I can't stop thinking about it. The sushi is super fresh and beautifully presented. Cute place, great sushi, awesome service, I'm totally hooked!"
truthful,"This place is awesome! I love Mexican food and I'm so glad I found this place. The blackened chicken quesadilla is sooo good, they give you tons of sour cream and delicious guacamole to enjoy it with. The chips/salsa/guacamole side is a must order. They're portions are fantastic, their food is consistently delicious, and they have my favorite frothy pina colada drink. I really couldn't ask for more, I love you Habaneros ;)"
truthful,"I love this place! Pho is one of my favorite dishes and I tried many other Vietnamese resturants before finding this gem. Now, I don't go anywhere else because Noodles Ranch is the best. Excellent food, fresh quality ingredients, great service. I feel great after eating here, not at all sluggish. The spring rolls are amazing, we usually get a few orders. The jasmine iced tea is fantastic. The owners are sweet and passionate about their business, they even have a cookbook out and available for purchase there."
truthful,"Pat is truly an artist! I love what she does to my hair, not to mention the way I feel after she works her magic. Her cuts are perfection, her highlights stunningly gorgeous. Whatever it is you want she can give it to you. Pat is experienced, talented, and knows how to make you look good. I even referred a guy friend to her who was frustrated after receiving mediocre cuts all around town. Needless to say, his hair looks great and with minimal effort which he loves. Also, this is my favorite Ulta, everyone is friendly and helpful."
truthful,"I love 5 & Diner! The cherry cokes, the mac 'n' cheese, Mrs. Cleaver's pot roast (no longer on the menu but you can still order it), the diner grilled chicken sandwich, and the most delicious root beer floats & shakes! Being a classic movie fan, of course I love the atmosphere and photos of movie stars that adorn the walls. Plus, some nights they have live rockabilly music and people bring their cool, classic cars. How awesome is that? There's no where else like this in Scottsdale. Oh yes and the service is excellent too!"
truthful,"Worst food and service ever. My boyfriend took one bite of their so called steak sandwich and said dog food. My boyfriend is nicer than I am. Seriously, I doubt my cat would've eaten it. What really got me however was the fact that when we politely informed the staff we were questioned 3 times about why it wasn't good. Now, I could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style. The man who questioned us could have been a manager but since he never identified himself he could have been anyone. I suggest the zipps staff eat it themselves and find out exactly why it's worthy of sending back. Don't bother when in the same complex there are truly excellent places to spend your money."
truthful,"I love this place, great service and amazingly delicious Chinese food. The sweet n sour chicken is my favorite. I've never had it better and I've eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants. I also love the vegetable fried rice, lemon chicken, and wonton soup. I've seen reviews that are unfavorable and to each his own but, really? I don't know what the hell they're talking about. This place rocks and does so consistently."
truthful,"Ethical and mechanic don't always go together, as anyone who's been scammed can attest. So, needless to say I am so happy I found Al at brakemasters! Trustworthy, honest, and friendly. I will not take my car anywhere else. I highly recommend Al to all my friends and fellow yelpers who are in need of car repairs or routine maintenance. If this location isn't near you, trust me, it's worth the drive."
truthful,"This place is awesome! A friend recommended it years ago and I'm so glad she did. The chicken salad sandwich is heavenly, a must try. Everything is fresh and delicious. This place is family owned and operated. They are super friendly people who remember you and make you feel welcome. Oh and did I mention to try the chicken salad? There's nothing like it anywhere, I love it and I'm sure you will too. Do make sure to bring cash as they dont accept anything else."
truthful,"Oh Sushi Kee, how I love thee! I've been coming here for years ever since a friend recommended it. Im glad she did because they have awesome rolls. My favorites are the Arizona, Hurricane, Tiger, Kee, Salmon Avacodo, and the California rolls are the best! The portions are huge, the service and Chefs are awesome. I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often."
truthful,"This is my go to Petco. It's close, convenient, and the staff are super friendly and helpful. I love being a pals rewards member since I get a $5 off coupon for every $100 I spend in store or online. They carry the brands I prefer, like Blue Buffalo and Dr. Elsey's (best kitty food and litter ever btw) and have sales often. Also, the fish are well cared for and healthy. I love that they do pet adoptions and give you an option to donate to animals in need. Kudos to Petco, I hope I always live close to this location."
truthful,"Love this place! Authentic, fresh and delicioso! I totally pig out whenever I go here. The carne asada street tacos are amazing, excellent nachos, yummy salsas. Friendly atmosphere and great prices, what's not to love? If you're looking for real Mexican food, go here, you won't be disappointed. A big thank you to my fellow Yelpers, another great find via your awesome reviews :)"
truthful,"Had a very enjoyable time at Vintage95 last Saturday night. The wait staff was top notch and very accommodating. Very comfortable atmosphere and furnishings. The young woman paying guitar was excellent ... wonderful renditions of a Roberta Flack and Cranberries tunes, among others. Looking forward to going back and sampling the single malts they have. 5 Stars for my date too!"
truthful,"The #22 Dinner Combo (String Bean in Black Bean Sauce w/ Shrimp) was the best black bean sauce I've had since leaving NY. Now, if they only had Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce  ;-), Looking forward to going back and trying their Singapore Style Mei Fun and other specialities."
truthful,Great food and service! Came here for a special occasion. Large variety of food on the menu! Will come again :)
truthful,"I'm mostly reiterating what other have said but with a few additions.  General - Bad ventilation. With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot. - Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing = Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.  Bouldering area + Decent number of routes and variety - Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere  Top rope area -The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird. - Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +/-. Why not put real YDS ratings? - For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before. - Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating."
truthful,We weren't planning on visiting here but saw a billboard (they work!) saying Jerry Seinfeld was on that night and we just couldn't miss out that opportunity!  So we ended up with seats towards the back but the view was still great along with the acoustics. Would make for a great venue to see some live acts in as well.
truthful,To be honest at first I didn't want to stay here as it seemed like it might be a bit 'tacky' but after being recommended by a few good friends we decided to book in as part of our US trip for 3 nights.  How wrong I was! Upon entering the driveway it was just 'wow' all of the way. The reception was massive and they had plenty of staff ready to book you in. The only one downside was that we had to go into a smoking room which did have some smell left to it but was gone in a matter of hours and reception did tell us we could change later that afternoon if it was still bad.  The room was very spacious and the bathroom was huge. The resort is massive and trust me it will take you some time to explore. The gym had a great setup and has plenty of equipment- no waiting like at the gym back home!  We gave the buffet a go and just like everyone said it's a must visit. They make just about anything there and have heaps of options to choose from.  All up well worth the stay and couldn't believe the price compared to other hotels in the USA.  ps. the blinds in the room operate by a switch - we spent a while trying to force them open haha!
truthful,"I read a lot of reviews about this buffet so on our last day I made sure to drop in as we were staying at the Bellagio.  Oh. My. God. This place was awesome! Not only did it have the widest choice of options I have ever seen at a buffet, the quality and presentation was like a top restaurant!  Highly recommend going here if you're after a good feed. Plenty of healthy choices as well but I must admit I gave in to quite a few of those tasty pastries... :)"
truthful,Nice casual bar located in the Aria hotel. To be honest I went here thinking it actually had a view across the city! Still a good find and it's a nice open bar with plenty of seating and some great drinks.  Just a word of warning the free snack include wasabi peas... didn't realise what they were at first but they made us go through our drinks pretty quick when we did!
truthful,Great spot for a quick treat if you're staying at the Bellagio. We had some of the pastries which tasted fresh and like something straight from a bakery.  The only downside was that the cafe was positioned on our walk back from the pool to the lifts.. ;)
truthful,Outside seating that's truly different!  As we were only in Vegas for a few nights we wanted to make sure we got to experience as much as possible - including the dining. After doing the usual hunt on Yelp we decided to try out Spago and it was a great suggestion.  When we arrived the waiter asked if we wanted sit inside or out and we opted to go outside - best choice! To be honest I thought the blue ceiling was tacky at first but after a while it really started to trick you that you were outside!  The food was awesome (as expected) but the service from the waiters was top notch as well. Highly recommend.
truthful,Our last night in Vegas and we wanted to make sure to finish off with a great meal and Bouchon delivered!  Not only were the meals great but the dessert we had was sooo good as well. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for something a bit different and a great atmosphere.
truthful,"Never being to a Cirque du Soleil before I didn't know fully what to expect but judging by what everyone else had told me, it would be an amazing show.  Happy to say it was superb and I'll be certain to see another if I get the chance! It was amazing to see the skills of the performers and it was a great mix of acrobatics, theatre and comedy.  Looking forward to the next one!"
truthful,We always love our Italian food so I couldn't resist checking out this place when we were inside Wynn checking out the casino.  It was a great find and the decor inside was executed perfectly! The staff we really quick to serve us and the meals came out really quick. We had asked for a white sauce instead of the tomato for one of our meals which they got wrong but were very apologetic and came out just as quick with another one for us.  All up a great meal and find in such a great casino.
truthful,Worth it just for the view.  We only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)  The drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.
truthful,We had been recommended Pink Jeep from some friends of ours and we're really thankful they did!  The trip was well organised with them picking us up from the hotel and then heading out to the Canyon. Our driver gave us some great commentary on the way out and had the perfect balance of not talking the whole time but still being really informative.  We stopped at a few spots on the way out including Hoover Dam and a small store for a rest stop which made the trip out there feel even more authentic going into an actual country store.  We didn't realise when we got there that we would all be going onto buses afterwards but the guide was really good at making sure we all had the freedom of looking around each lookout and then still grouping back together at the end.  Thanks for making it an easy and great trip!
truthful,This place is a must visit for anyone to Las Vegas!  I'm so thankful I came across it on here as it was never suggested to us by anyone else or even at the hotel we were staying. You start off the tour at their meeting spot where they give you plenty of water and warnings about just how hot it can get in there so be careful!  We got to meet our tour guide as well who gave us a quick background on the non-profit organisation behind the museum - it's great to see such a dedicated group of people preserving what some people would just treat as junk.  It's an amazing collection of old signage and as part of the tour around the 'boneyard' the guide gave us some great (and humorous) history about Las Vegas.  This really made the tour as there was so much we learnt at the same time and it was astonishing to learn just how much the city has changed.  If you like your photography this place is an absolute must visit. There's so many good opportunities as the place is full of so much colour and typography.  Stop reading my review and book in now! :)
truthful,"Roast beef was amazing that sandwich alone will bring me back again before I leave Vegas.  I didn't care for the pizza I've had better.  But that sandwich was easily one of the best I've had.  I ordered a pizza, chips and drink and the roast beef sandwich for about $20.  The veggie sandwich is around $8 is also great. And the BLT is good as well."
truthful,"came here on Monday, no line. its good, but not to go out of your way good.  price is reasonable, it is hard to find. but that was the fun of it trying to find it.  no name, no sign.  if your clubbing @ the Cosmo and your have the munchies this is your place.  they use fresh toppings, crust is thin and very tasty."
truthful,It's ok if it fits your budget. Plus when you get out your on freemont.  But if you are not a silly person or don't have enough drinks in you it will be hard to get into. Buy your tickets at tix4tonight on the strip it comes out to $104 for two. Don't get the pasta most didn't finish there's.  Chicken was o.k.   sodas are free and well drinks are $6.
truthful,"for the PRICE the rooms are huge and very comfortable. the AC. was strong, for 110 degree heat, the beds were comfy and they have a hid abed. large bathrooms separate tub and shower. this place is a hotel first and casino second. All the rooms are in different buildings from the casino which makes it very family friendly.         front desk was very friendly and helpful. Even though its not on the strip its a block and half away from the center of the strip. a short cab ride or a short walk and you can be at ceasers palace, bellagio, paris,and bally's for the shuttle to the Rio. wi-fi is free in the lobby and pool side. there is a fee to have it in your room. there is a resort fee if you book it through a third party like orbitz, travelocity, priceline,etc. you should check there price first and see if you can save some money. i was there from Thursday to Monday on labor day weekend. it was quite and peace full as appose to the chaos of the strip on a holiday weekend."
truthful,"Again great deal for the price and location plus free breakfast.  $50 on Saturday.  King room, flat t.v.,kureg coffee, good water pressure, did not hear the people next door and hope they didn't hear us. (Unlike planet Hollywood where you hear everything)"
truthful,"cant go wrong here, in the mood for sandwich this is it. its baked and toasty, healthy and filling. its not as good as jersey mikes but almost there.  price is very Worth it."
truthful,OK OK this is the BEST buffet in Vegas period.  there is a lot of variety. the desserts are very good.  The lamb shoulder cooked to perfection.  but what does it is FREE all you can drink beer and wine.  I'm talkin about the regular buffet on Wednesday under $55 for two.  without a players club. we got to the line around 7 and were seated about 7:15. it wasn't to busy. at the dessert bar you can order fresh coffee or a latte with Kahlua. If somebody hadn't told us we wouldn't have known.        everything was really good. The place is very clean.  Don't bother looking for the bathroom its not in the Buffet its outside to the right.
truthful,this is for the fireside lounge. great place to finish the night off or start it.  the appetizers were large portions and the well drinks were also great.  it has a old las Vegas feel to it
truthful,"mystery adventure is must do Sunday Thru Thursday. its great but its 3hrs+ long. i like the fact that it had something for everybody. you don't have to be a mystery junkie to enjoy the adventure. and for the price you really cant beat it. nothing in Vegas will keep you entertain for so long for so little, plus there's snacks to munch on while you try to look for clues. The one thing that is definitely fun is to determine what clues you need to solve the mystery and what clues you don't.   you'll get to meet people and work as a team to solve the mystery.  if your on a tight budget this is a must."
truthful,"besides going up the Eiffel tower and the crepes its the only reason i even step inside the Paris casino.  I've been here several times already and it hasn't gotten old.  no cover, two drink minimum and  pricey to, if you haven't you must.  two guys on a piano going at it.  they play everything from oldies to today's music."
truthful,"i was there from June 24 to 27th. the room big enough for four adults. we checked in early and we got a room on the 25th floor facing the strip. that was the best part. the view was unbelievable. the AC. was strong. the room was very modern and clean. the beds were very comfortable. the casino i didn't care to much about nothing special to see or write about. there is a free show outside the hotel. if you haven't seen it. its worth check out. the area is pretty good, there is tram to the mirage and next to that is ceasers palace and on the other side is a big mall. accross the street is the Venetian, Harras casino (and a shuttle to Rio that were the best buffet in vagas)and the carnival bar. pool parties are not the worst but not the best either. the DJ was pretty good ,the down side very little shade.   there is a mandatory $22 a day resort fee that includes wi-fi in every room and newspaper in the lobby. they don't tell you about the fee until you check in."
truthful,"great tip i found by accident. book your room through www.easyclicktravel.com and you wont pay a resort fee of $20 per night.  I'm not sure if it works for other hotels as well.  the hotel is great location, great bathtub, comfy bed, good or great view of the strip depending on your room.  only downside is walls are thin. you can hear the next room so gotta keep the TV. turned up."
truthful,"it doesn't get better than green valley ranch sports-book.  1 dollar beer, 1 dollar hot dogs, turf grill only top of the line food and priced very good, plus free well drinks when you gamble (must get coupon when you place wager).  get there early and you get your own TV. booth., the waitresses are very thorough, they walk down every isle and ask everybody if the want a drink. unlike ceasers.  the whole right side is for football and the left is for horse racing,  but you can pretty much sit anywhere."
truthful,pros-  our window was from floor to cielling and wall to wall with a view of the strip huge rooms  huge bed fridge in closet  safe lots of mirriors shuttle to the strip only SEAFOOD buffet in Vegas that i know of the A/C is strong  cons- resort fee unless you book with easyclicktravel.com then you dont pay resort fee. carnival buffet could be better pool needs more shade
truthful,"This place is a coffee shop by day, and a bar by night, which may help explain the stripper pole and the dance floor.   Really nice atmosphere, lounge-like seating areas and free wifi. What's not to like?  Well. While I did appreciate not being charged for soy milk, and I liked that they charged extra for to go/paper cups (I think it was 50 cents) the soy latte I had was totally awful.   Bitter, sour and composed of mostly foam. Maybe this was an off day, but it was honestly atrocious. I wouldn't mind visiting Blondie's in the evening sometime, but I think I'll just skip the coffee from now on."
truthful,"Relaxing atmosphere, educational chalk based corn diagrams, and air conditioning... what more could you ask for? Well, add to all of that, that the food is delicious. Maizal is a recent addition to the Liberty Village area. They have vegan and gluten-free options in addition to non-vegan/veg ones.  The menu is short and simple. At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.) All very yummy sounding options. Their tortillas are entirely corn based (and gluten-free) and made fresh every morning. (they also happen to be delicious.)  Other things on the menu I should mention: the horchata. Traditionally milk-less, it's rice based at Maizal, with a cinnamon spice, and perfectly ice cold.   Outdoor patio space is out front on Jefferson, and small but decent. Interior space is ample, but I imagine it's going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser, a tasty, healthy meal for under ten dollars. If you sit in like we did, you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards (and no joke, it really is interesting.) And let me say it again: Air Conditioning.  We each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sin-queso (no cheese.) We sat sipping on horchata's while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams. They arrived, with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce, and a side of refried beans.  One poblano pepper and one mushroom. One bite and I've decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic. That one bite was all tortilla, and it was so rich in maizey-flavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas I've had up until now (so I eat a lot of tacos...)  The fillings for both were great, both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours. Add some of the pico and a touch of lettuce and it is perfection. The folks at Maizal are doing exciting things with food, and I'm looking forward to seeing more, and eating much more from them.  p.s. prices are reasonable."
truthful,"This is another place I'd never have stumbled upon had it not been for the Indie Coffee Passport. I'm never in the George Brown area. We dropped in on a Saturday morning and it was mostly empty.  Walking by, it looks like an old antique furniture store with a random assortment of unmatched pieces.  No, but really, I like random, and I like the atmosphere, it's weird but well lit. I'll call it... cozy. I liked the big wooden table by the window I didn't have any luck connecting to their wifi with my ipod but I saw other people on laptops tapping away. Minimal plug ins, but they exist.  It was a beautiful looking cup of coffee, but it may have also been the worst almond latte I've ever drank. I think it's great that they offer almond milk, but I'm not convinced they knew how to use it that day. Overall... my problem was that the coffee was very bitter. Way too bitter.   Although it didn't effect me, this place is cash only. No Debit Cards Allowed!"
truthful,"I went to Z-Teca for the first time a few weeks ago after being really excited to try it out. Unfortunately, as with most over hyped oversold places, once I did try it, I was really disappointed.  Service was friendly but the flavour was lacking. It felt like I had gone to Chipotle, but so much worse. The rice and vegetables were boring, and rice was in copious amounts. Beans are optional/extra? What is up with that? It's a burrito!  I doused my burrito in hot sauce to give it some flavour, and vowed to find some where else to go next time I was hungry in Fairview Mall."
truthful,"So it's the first day Tori's Bakeshop is open, so maybe it's premature to review them... but I can't help it. Yelp must know about a new vegan & gluten free friendly bakery.  It took me about 40 minutes on the Queen streetcar  to get here after work... but it was worth it. Since it was the end of the day, they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats (even after apparently baking 3 day's worth of things) but I grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting, a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and a gluten free butter tart (and a non gluten free butter tart). They were all delicious. The cupcake was spongy and fluffy, the icing sweet, whipped, and not stiff at all. I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.  Friendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it. One word sums this place up -  adorable. (In two words - adorably delicious.) I love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic. Lots of greens and neutral tones.  Also - wifi.Free functional wifi. There are outlets all over the place if you look for them (one main one that I know of is right at the front corner with the comfy seating. Yes.  Golly I wish this was closer to parkdale/trinity-bellwoods - though odds are, I'll be back really really soon."
truthful,"I'm not quite sure what the fuss is about about Chipotle. My burrito was flavourless and unexciting. When I bit into it I couldn't help but think... wow, I waited 15 minutes in line for THIS?   I think it didn't help that one of the members of counter staff left right as I got to her station, so I stood there an extra 5 or 6 minutes waiting for someone further down the chain to realize... oh nothing is happening.  The one of the things I did like was the tortilla chips with the hint of lime and the fresh pico.  Maybe I had a bad experience, maybe I've just had really amazing Mexican food, maybe I should try them again, or maybe I should just try a different location."
truthful,"I'm late to the Hot Beans praising party, but not late in trying out their delicious tacos and donuts. Taking a bite out of one of their fresh lime coconut donuts makes me want to write poetry, but it looks like another reviewer has taken care of that.  So what can I say, I haven't eaten anything here I didn't like. The tacos are all delicious (though my favourite is the Yuba), and an order of nachos is filling and flavourful with spiced beans, cashew cream cheese, some kind of cheese sauce and veggies. I've been eyeing those burritos, but haven't gotten around to ordering one yet.  I'm happy to see a couple of different hot sauces on the side bench, along with a help yourself collection of water jugs. You might notice the lack of garbage can, well, everything is biodegradable. Which is awesome, but I can't help but be compelled to bring along a reusable container with me so I don't waste any more paper bags on donuts I inhale in 5 minutes anyway.  The limeade can be a bit too heavy on the agave sometimes, but otherwise I have no serious complaints. Service depends on the day and who's at the counter, but it's usually somewhere between decent and awesome.  The seating is limited to about 9-12 people depending on where you're sitting, but it hasn't felt crowded any of the (several several several) times I've gone in. There is a lot of foot traffic, people running in and out to grab a quick bite.   The simplicity of their menu and pricing scheme is appreciated, just enough choice, without too much choice. What you see on the board, is what you will pay (tax is included), and combining donuts and tacos or beverages results in a nice round number which nutty folks like me will appreciate.  I haven't checked them out for breakfast on the weekends, but it's definitely on my to do list. Breakfast burritos... tempting, tempting.  Seriously, vegan or otherwise, at the very least pick up a donut, you wont regret it, really, go. Eat."
truthful,"I've lived in Toronto for two whole years as of this month, and I have never once had  a bad time there. More often than not, we've gone there for brunch, and the service has been stellar. Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).  A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.  I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.  I've gone with friends, I've gone with family, I've gone in pairs, I've gone in big groups. Go for brunch. It's great. Go for drinks, it's fun.   Other stuff: Cash only (but there is an ATM inside), they have baked goods and cheesecake from Through Being Cool (vegan) bakery, and conveniently close to Nazareth Ethiopian restaurant (eat delicious Ethiopian food then go drinking)."
truthful,"I finally went to Burritos Boyz the other day and I was really pleased with what I got. Flavourwise and servicewise it trumps Chipotle entirely.  I got a vegan burrito and didn't feel deprived of anything, it was a nice big meal. I really liked how they constructed it. It made a huge difference when biting in. There was an intermingling of flavours rather then the usual ""oh here's rice, oh here's lettuce, oh here's salsa""  feeling I get from some other places. It was quite filling, though I probably could have eaten two for lunch. I think grilling the burrito is a nice touch, crispy on the outside warm and yummy on the inside.   They have veggie ground round, and vegan guacamole, and hot sauce that's actually hot. I wish they also had some daiya, because that would have made this place all around perfect.  We got there right before the lunchtime rush, so not only did we get our orders quickly, I even snagged a seat in the corner."
truthful,"There are a few vegan options here, and they are labelled clearly on the chalkboard near the cashier (though they don't always write everything they're serving on the board).   Service was friendly and quick, I ordered the sweet potato and rapini pie, which wasn't as tasty as the dish my friends ordered (the cauliflower and soy protein pie). They have a vegan cheesecake that is phenomenal.  It's a cozy little space, and there were a few other folks there when we walked in on Saturday, but it didn't feel too crowded.  I'll have to try their coffee next time."
truthful,"I went here last week on Friday, and it was great. I wondered why it had taken me so long to actually go in (well I know why, the outside doesn't look nearly as inviting as the inside does). Menu is colour coded and vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, or non-veg friendly. There is probably something for everyone here which makes it a good potential spot to take non-veg in-laws or something.   Service was great, our server seemed to actually like it there, and was knowledgeable about the menu.  I had the phish and chips and would totally eat them again, pretty delicious. Crispy deepfried pieces of tender tofu, with a side of chips and spicy house made tartar sauce.  I think it's time to check them out for a Sunday brunch and see what it looks like on a busy day."
truthful,"I prefer this location to the other ones in the city. We live really close to the Queen West one, but order delivery or dine-in at this one.  Dine in service is always friendly, and quick. Dishes are veganizable, there are lots of options, the food is always tasty and the portions are huge (we're eaters, but we still end up taking food home with us). The food could be spicier, but that seems pretty standard in this city and nothing a bit of hot sauce can't fix.  My delivery experiences have varied. When I order things through Order-It or Just Eat,  the resulting delivery takes forever, there are often issues with our order (like egg in the pad thai when we specifically said vegan/no egg), and the prices are more expensive than just ordering directly.   So we started calling them to place delivery orders and things went much more smoothly. Orders seemed to come faster with no mistakes."
truthful,"I went to check out Kupfert & Kim today at First Canadian Place. It was reasonably busy, even at 3pm.  Service was friendly - though it seems like they have a lot of staff behind a very small counter (maybe it was shift change?) It's a very clean looking space, and I like the selection of vegan and gluten-free sweet treats, like stuff from Earth & City, Bunners Bake Shop, and Rawlly Delicious.  I ordered the ""First Canadian"" , and while I've often felt really bored with bowls of vegetables/grains/etc, this one was a great mix of ingredients - tempeh, quinoa,  shredded red and green cabbage, sweet potato, and a flavourful dressing on the side.  They've got a decent selection of milks (soy, almond, coconut, and  rice) for prepared coffee drinks like cappuccino, lattes, etc.  and fresh juices.  Open from 8am to 5pm, they've got breakfast and lunch menus and seem like a great option for meatless, wheatless, fare in the Financial District.  They just opened two weeks ago, so they still seem to be working out all the kinks, and they don't have a (useful) website yet, but as far as the food is concerned - so far so good!"
truthful,"Love this place. Sure it was way out of town for me. Sure I can't figure out a way to get there with public transit from Toronto... BUT it's worth the trip, however you get there.  To be honest, before we went there I thought it was just going to be danishes, which was actually exciting in and of itself, BUT it had a variety of other Danish baked goods (like marzipan cookies, and kransekake ) as well as vegan chocolate bars, chocolate soft serve, cookies, brownies and biscotti. And little grocery type items like fake tuna and non-dairy cheese.  The woman that runs the bakery is so sweet and friendly, I felt like I could talk to her all day about food and not get tired of it. Another great part about this place is that it's inside of a costume shop. Can't go wrong with that."
truthful,"I neglected to read the reviews on here regarding the Greyhound/Toronto Coach Lines line, and stood in line (at 5am I might add, 5am does not make me a happy camper) for 15 minutes while a woman argued with the counter guy about something ridiculous. I don't envy these people their jobs, I can't imagine the crap they have to deal with.  So I came to the counter, talking about Greyhound, he told me (and it's probably been the millionth+1 time he's said this.) to go to the greyhound counter down in the waiting room and talk to the guy in the vest. Well, shucks. Who knew.   The waiting room was clean, my ticket situation was sorted out without any issue well before my bus arrived, so I really don't have any complaints.  I really hate going through airport security, and for certain trips (like NYC for example) the rates on the greyhound are really reasonable (especially with advanced purchase), I usually don't have to sit with anyone AND most importantly (is she joking?), I can get wifi the entire way down."
truthful,"I'd like to say I loved this place, because for the most part I did.  The veggie selection was beautiful, the store was bright and clean, but ultimately, all of that was ruined by my experience at the check out.  I went through the self check out, you know, so I could avoid talking to cashiers and go through the process quickly? Instead the attendant would not leave me alone and it took twice as long.  He hovered and hassled me the entire time I was going through the check out, he yelled out the veggies at me that I was buying from his station, and it was really frustrating. It totally ruined the whole experience for me.   If I do go back, I'm not going to bother doing self check-out (and I don't recommend anyone else does either), not much point if someone is going to micromanage the entire process.  I would have given this place a five, I wanted to give this place a two after I left, but it gets a begrudging three because it has such a nice selection and a clean bright location."
truthful,"First of all, this is probably the best Vegetarian restaurant I've been to in the Toronto area, and probably in my top ten of vegetarian restaurants I've been to in North America.  I took a big burly omnivore with me, and he loved everything we ordered, so I take that as a great sign.  We started things off with an order of crispy oyster mushrooms and seared dumplings. I wish we had ordered two orders of the crispy oyster mushrooms because I can never have enough, they are so rich and flavourful and the sweet slightly spiced sauce is a perfect compliment for it.  We both ordered the Special of the Day, which was a tofu skin wrapped taro root mash on a bed of greens, with a side of noodles, and a flavour explosion of a mango salad.   Our waitress totally sold it. Her description got my mouth watering from the very beginning. It adds so much to a meal when the server is friendly, and she was wonderful. Moreover, she clearly loved the place and the food, which is exactly the type of person I want advising me on what to order.  I was feeling pretty full after finishing my plate, but there is always room for dessert. My dining companion and I shared a piece of chocolate cake and a brownie sundae (but since they were out of brownie, they used lightly warmed chocolate cookies.)  What can I say, other than delicious! delicious! delicious!   The chocolate cake was good, but not as good as the sundae. Though I'm glad our server made sure we took the left over chocolate cake home, because while it wasn't as awesome when it went head to head with the sundae, it was fantastic by itself at 3am.  In Short:  - order the crispy mushrooms, you wont be disappointed.  - And the Special; it's consistently amazing."
truthful,"I've been travelling a lot lately and in the time I was away having fun and eating lots of great food, Bloomers opened and I was really looking forward to coming home and visiting this (still) new vegan cafe and bakery in Bloorcourt.  So finally,I got to visit them today.   First impressions are: I love the wide open space, that there are multiple options for seating (booths, tables, high tables, etc). They've got free wifi (I didn't look for power outlets this time). Service was really nice and friendly. And I felt pretty comfortable just hanging out with my coffee for a bit  Today I saw a couple of different kinds of donuts, fluffy coconut donut holes, chocolate chip cookies, butter tarts, blueberry tarts, BAGELS, and a donut Bread pudding, and probably more, but I was especially drawn to the bagels, as I haven't seen bagels around any of the fine vegan bakeries we have in our city AND I happen to really like bagels (and usually end up making them myself). as an added bonus they had tofutti cream cheese available.   They've got a variety of kombuchas, teas, blue sky soda, and assorted bottled fruit juices, in addition to fancy (and more regular) coffee options.   I hear there is a menu extension coming in September with sandwiches and the like coming soon, so I'm pretty excited to check that out too when it appears.  I liked it here, I would (and will) be back again soon.   Accessibility-wise: Today the door was wide open (otherwise it's not powered), but there is a bit of a quarter step to get in. And  in a wonderful departure from the usual Toronto bathroom in the basement style the restroom is on the main floor.  And regarding one of the other reviews... it seems a little (no, it seems a lot) ridiculous to complain about the lack of dairy products at a vegan cafe."
truthful,"I come here about once every two weeks, mostly out of convenience, since it's near my workplace, has vegan options, and offers a decent alternative to subway/sushi/pizza options I have in the area.  Service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other Indian restaurants do in the area. Ew.   I've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland.  They are spiced but not really (especially if you've gotten used to more authentic little India flavours) and just generally have a ""healthy"" flavor to them. it's not terrible, but miss-able.   I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.  They've recently upped the price of the samosas, but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under $5."
truthful,"I like this place.  I need to go back on a Friday or Saturday night to see what it's really like, but I went a couple hours before closing on a Wednesday with Nicole H, and it was pretty comfortable with four tables occupied.  I like the interior, it seems like a place I would actually go to just drink coffee or do some work, with the added benefit of having games available if I wanted to play them.  They have a great selection of games in the back, and various events happen every week, including a Scrabble meetup group (Scrabble in the City) every Thursday night.  Beer and other alcohol selection appears ample, but since it was 3 pm on a Wednesday, I opted for tea. Prices for food and drinks are very reasonable, as of yet, there is no game playing fee.  As an extra bonus, service is friendly but also unintrusive.  No on-menu vegan food options or treats (yet), but they do make veg sandwiches with hummus, which is something."
truthful,"I thought I was finished with Fresh, but a friend from out of town came to visit, and wanted to come here for brunch. So... okay, back to Fresh.  It still didn't win me over.  But this visit was better than before.  Our server was a bit weird, but ultimately helpful and friendly so that's all that matters. One of the other servers ""helping"" the table next to us was terrible and I'm glad we didn't have her. She seemed to be all attitude, and no help.  Brunch was great. I got the pancake platter, which comes with two pancakes of your choice, two vegan breakfast sausages and tofu scramble (for 12$). I could have done without the over-spiced boring tofu scramble, but the pancakes (banana-nut flavoured) were excellent, especially when slathered with margarine and dark rich maple syrup. Tofu sausage was fantastic.  I got an americano.  And while it wasn't a very big cup of coffee, or very caffeinated, it was very tasty.  I also ordered a side of soy yogurt, but really, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you get some jam. It's not flavoured with anything so when you order soy yogurt that's really all it is, and it's not very good.   Next time (since there will probably always be a next time with this place): BBQ Burger. How can I go wrong with a veggie burger, that also includes a couple of those delicious quinoa onion rings?"
truthful,"We went to Bello Bio earlier this month to check out their selection of products. All the food items there are vegan, and imported from Italy. The imported part sounded a little strange, since I've never thought of Italy as a very veg friendly place, but we learned from the owner, that Italy has a growing vegan/vegetarian population  Great selection of random products. They have grain based pseudo-meats, and a very interesting MozzaRisella sprouted rice based soft dairy free cheese, which made an excellent addition to a recent caprese salad. They have prepared foods, and frozen items available to take home (such as varieties of vegan stuffed ravioli.)  Those folks are friendly, and the products have a lot to offer flavourwise. And I liked that they have products that are vegan/plant-based, without depending entirely on soy.  I'm looking forward to going back and picking up more stuff soon!"
truthful,"We ordered delivery from this location and it was okay. But not amazing.   I think their queen street location is better, or maybe we hit them on the wrong day. The fredo pizza is normally covered with thinly sliced potato and a nice level of rosemary and other spices, this time around, it was rather sparse.   Considering they said an hour for delivery, and we were only 6 minutes away (if you walk), I would have expected they'd have enough time to actually cook the potatoes properly. I wish we had just picked it up, maybe it would have been better.   They have three vegan pizza's on the menu and an extensive combination of other types as well. So I'd start the Pizziolo experience at a different location if you want something especially good.   That said, my slightly undercooked potato pizza was still better flavour-wise than the Pizza Pizza in the neighbourhood."
truthful,"Easy wasn't easy. I considered getting a smoothie and word on the street is their coffee is stellar.   But it was busy, and after about 10-15 minutes, with no coffee, we left before ordering."
truthful,"I've watch D-Beatstro improved their offerings and options over the last few months and it's been great to see them grow from sort of disorganized but charming to really having a solid menu, kitchen, and coffee set up. They have a nice variety of baked goods, occasionally have gluten-free options too for those of you that need/want them, and herbalist blended teas available. But my favourite thing now is their brunch, because it's good, really good.  Seating is comfortable and well spaced out, so if you're tired of sharing elbow room with other folks during weekend brunches - this might be a great spot to check out. The restaurant and cafe is also wheelchair and/or mobility device accessible with a ramp outside (they also have an accessible washroom.)  The folks here make a great soy latte, and why anyone would recommend going to a Starbucks or Tim Hortons over even a non-dairy latte, I don't understand, but Kevin S. you do you. They also have a variety of other fun drinks - like hot chocolate, white hot chocolate, matcha lattes, and other surprises in store for you.  They also ""only"" have soy, almond, coconut, and cashew. Oh no, too many options? Branch out a little.  Check em out for brunch or during the week."
truthful,"You know those times when you visit a cafe or store and leave with the desire to tell everyone you meet how wonderful it is? That's how I feel about this place.  They have a great warm inviting atmosphere, and it's a cozy (i.e., kind of a small space). While there is room for about three people to sit in the window area, prepare to either stand and eat, or take a box home (or eat there, AND take a box of treats home like I did...)  The people working there are friendly and helpful, and when I walked in, all wide-eyed and overwhelmed with options, they gave me a run down of what they had and offered some recommendations. Bunner's was just all around fantastic from the start. And then... I ate one of the ""gypsy"" cookies, and I was completely sold. Oats, melty chocolate chips, dried cranberries and a few other things combined into a soft chewy cookie. I want to go back, right now, and get another one.  I should probably mention that in my experience gluten free tends to secretly mean gross, and I have been known to occasionally thank my body for not having celiac disease. So what I'm saying when I say this place is good, is that it's not just gluten-free good. It's actually good.  When I went in today there were cupcakes (three different kinds: vanilla, chocolate and red velvet), DONUTS, amazingly yummy cookies (gypsy cookie), freshly baked loaves of bread (which I'm kicking myself for not trying), muffins, and cookie sandwiches!  What I'm going to hope for is that every coffee shop in town starts using them as their source for vegan (and/or gluten free) treats. While they have decent enough coffee (and Silk Soy creamer is available), I sure wouldn't mind having one of their cookies or muffins with a nice soy latte. (Of course... Crema Coffee is just across the street...)"
truthful,"Balluchon is now i deal coffee. It's basically the same place, but better.  I love this place now, so my regular Monday Sorauren Farmers' Market visit is paired with a tasty cup of coffee from -i deal coffee- as well.  Service has been fantastic every time I've gone in. It feels like a space that's good to hang out in, they have vegan and/or gluten-free options, and have soy and almond milk at no extra charge (YEY!)  So lovely. I can't wait to keep going back.  As an added bonus, since they only recently took over that location they are part of the Indie Coffee Passport less-than-3 Edition, so you can give them a try, while taking advantage of a really great deal.  They're currently cash only, but it sounded like they were planning on getting a debit machine at some point."
truthful,"You might have seen this vegan bakery win the Toronto Vegetarian Association's Vegan Bake Off (repeatedly), and you've might have seen it at the Vegetarian Food Festival, or at the Farmers Market or a bunch of other places around the city (and Ontario).  Now, you'll see it in a sweet location in the Annex.  Full disclosure: I've been excited about this bakery opening for months, and I don't care who knows it. I have wanted a source for a steady supply of vegan magic squares, and now I have one (p.s. get the magic squares)  I had the opportunity to visit the bakery during the sneak-peak opening in December, and bought magic squares (but not enough), a cookie, and a couple of candied apples and it felt like early Xmas.  Then I waited (im)patiently for their opening this month. And today I braved the snow and went in. I left with dark chocolate croissants, magic squares (obviously), and a pot pie. My partner came home with croissants, a couple of sausage rolls and a whoopie pie. Yes, we're getting ready to hibernate this weekend.  The croissants are ridiculously flaky, the magic squares are incredible as usual, I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I've sort of come to expect that anything from APiecalypse Now! will be really good.  In the fridge & freezer so far they've got (all of these things are vegan): cashew ricotta, Caesar salad dressing, flavoured butters, lasagna, pot pies, shepherd pie, gluten free and gluten-full chili mac, potato salad, tzatziki, tartar sauce, Northwood Cold Brew Coffee (which I'm drinking right now - tasty), and more.  I like that there appears to be a sincere effort made to find ethical, ecologically sound, and human friendly products to make & bake stuff, and that they have compostable packaging.  Service was friendly and fast & they take cash, credit, and debit.  There is no seating inside, so prepare to take out.  P.S. try the magic squares."
truthful,"This place is huge, but lacks seating. I spent a considerable amount of time visualizing how they could fit more tables in without getting to crowded, and I can see why they set it up the way they did. But a couple more tables wouldn't hurt. (but that's what everyone says).  I love the space. Floor to ceiling windows facing Queen St and the rest is brick. High ceilings, ample bookshelves and the random old stove in the center... it just works.  I ordered a soy latte, and it was delicious, not too bitter, not too boring. Foam was nice and thick (but not too much) Just right. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have any ""to stay"" cups. But on the plus side, they've got free wifi and they don't charge extra for soy milk.  One thing I find really cool about Ground Level is that it operates as part of Ground Level Youth Ventures where youth learn life skills and job training (beyond just making coffee). Definitely something I'm into supporting.  I went here solely because it was part of the Indie Coffee Passport, but I'll go there again if I'm in the neighbourhood. My latte was better than the cups I've gotten from other shops in the area."
truthful,"Feel Good Guru is in the progress of slowly opening.  It's a take-out place right across the street from Trinity-Bellwoods Park, and conveniently located in my neighbourhood. I walked in not caring what I ordered, I wanted to try... anything.   I ordered the soup, which was a hearty miso based vegetable lentil, with lots of greens and packed with flavour. Perfect for today's rainy glumness.  The space is really clean and relaxing, there is seating for about 4 people, but like I said, it's styled as a take-out place (so you know, you could hypothetically take stuff out, and eat in the park.) There are fresh herbs in a wall-mounted garden (that look absolutely lovely). They also have a useful website that actually gives you the information   I've come to expect raw cakes to be delicious, and Feel Good Guru's cake was no exception. In fact... it was even better than I expected it to be (and the raw bar is raised pretty high already.)  She gave me a sample for free, and I want more of that chocolate heaven in my mouth. Luckily they are right down the street, so I could wander over any time I want. Lucky me."
truthful,"Meh. I'd feel okay just leaving the review at that. This place embodies meh, I've had better.   I walk by every day on the way to work, so I thought... maybe this will be my alternative to Starbucks or (on days when I feel like being treated rudely) Tim Hortons. Nope.  The coffee tasted burnt, in a bad way. And soy milk is 0.70 cents extra (I hate that.)  I was oversold on the 20$ gift card. I like going out for coffee because it's relaxing - I didn't expect to have to say ""no not interested"" to some pseudo promotion (gift card - meh) repeatedly.  With the exception of the sales pitch,  service in general was quite friendly though. But not friendly enough that I would go back again."
truthful,"This location was my first foray into the Pizzaiolo chain since moving to Toronto.  We went to this location at 3am on a Saturday night and asked for half a fredo (with potatoes, rosemary and oregano)  and half a vittoria (tomatos, zucchini, red peppers). They didn't even blink, no problem, done. When we got it, it was packed with toppings, hot and delicious. Everything seemed cooked to perfection.   Afterwards service was a bit off, I tried to buy a drink, and stood at the counter, drink in hand while the server talked on the phone... for about five minutes. Then I put the drink back in the fridge and sat down to finish my pizza.   On the plus side, the variety of pizza they offer is nice, they have vegan and vegetarian pizza available by the slice (amongst others), and they are open super late."
truthful,"It's a Starbucks, with the same problems and benefits that every Starbucks has. The coffee is the same as every other starbucks, and they never seem to use separate containers for soy and dairy frappuccinos but they are quick, there is lots of seating, and a good collection of power outlets at this location (you just have to find them)  Overall, it's always clean, some of the staff are reasonably friendly."
truthful,"No more trudging downtown to get a oily slice of potato rosemary (The Fredo) pizza for me, finally, a new Pizzaiolo up north and in my neighbourhood.  This location is clean, and at 4pm, completely empty except for the reasonably friendly dudes working there. They had a special deal going on for a free beverage with purchase for their grand opening (which is now over) but honored my request anyway. Free soda is always a plus.   Pizza was decent. One half of the GIANT slice was perfect, the other half was more than half of my daily requirement of olive oil. Crispy tasty crust, maybe verging on too crispy, but it was still within tolerance levels. Also, I'm happy that they actually had a vegan pizza available, which is more than I can say for half of the downtown locations I've been to after 7pm.   I'd come here again and I hope business picks up because that area has been lacking in quick tasty (vegan or otherwise) food options."
truthful,"I've been going to Totum for almost a year now I think, and it's been great for seriously getting into weight lifting without having to navigate through clusters of bros and other gym jerks. Everyone is generally nice, respectful of space, and you know, no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat rack.  I still haven't convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes, but they exist for those pre-work workout fiends. I'm just too much of a night owl. I'm also lazy.  Classes to chose from include yoga classes, Pilates, boxing, kettle bell workouts, spinning, crossfit, and a whole bunch of others. Lots of elliptical machines, 5-6 treadmills, and bikes. They also have a decent variety of weight machines, free weights, and other equipment to play with.  There is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing techno/dub/remix (you know, perfect workout music) to some weird classic rock/easy listening/crud, so word of advice - bring some headphones if you're going in the middle of the day. The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they're open later than most gyms on Fridays.  One other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site. In addition to personal trainers, there are chiropractors, RMTs, a holistic nutritionist, and an ND. It's nice to have the option of just going in, working out, seeing an RMT, or someone else, and going home.  It's clean, friendly, and welcoming. There is a free week trial, and I'd totally recommend you try it out. But only if you're awesome.  Worst/best thing - it's right next to Soma Chocolate."
truthful,"I went to Nazareth yesterday and we lucked out because it was nearly empty inside (however it filled up within 30 minutes of our arrival and then there was a bit of a line.)  The service was fast and friendly, but there was a bit of a wait to get our actual plate, but it wasn't uncomfortably long. Our server checked on us regularly and was very pleasant.  We ordered one order of the vegetarian combination plate, and between the two of us, we still didn't finish all of it.  Over all it was a great experience, we got there at just the right time and the bill was ridiculously cheap."
truthful,"Upon walking in I was delighted to see that they brew a very familiar coffee, Stumptown Coffee (the coffee found in nearly every coffee shop everywhere in Portland, Oregon... aka Stumptown.) The nostalgia was short lived, I think I prefer the Intelligencia coffee I've had nearly everywhere else in the city.  My barista was friendly, and helped me out right away, so that part was nice.   They charge extra for soy milk, and in doing so, became the most expensive latte I've had in Toronto (however, I should also mention, the portion is comparatively bigger than other places so I'm not exactly complaining about that part.)  Lit has WiFi! Lots of seating, and a nice interior."
truthful,"I like this place, I guess that's why I keep coming back. The seats are comfortable, I like that I can lean back, and the temperature has always been decent (unlike some places). The location can't be beat (easy access from Dundas Subway).  I know some people aren't into the ""butter flavoured topping"" that AMC has going on, but I love that it's available. Not that it's in anyway good for you (mmm soybean oil...), just that all signs point to its veganness, which works for me.  As with every movie theater, they will gouge you at the concession, and make you wish you had the foresight to sneak in your own snacks."
truthful,"I didn't mean to go to Freshii for lunch the other day, but events conspired in such a way that I was in the neighbourhood (hoping to buy a Indie Coffee Pass from Crema Coffee - but they were sold out) and the line was short (because their debit was down) and my stomach decided it was time to eat.  After looking at the menu board, I filled out the custom order form (and there were LOTS of options to choose from.) s  and handed it to the nice server informing everyone that the debit machine wasn't working. (right at noon time! what terrible timing!)  I got the spinach wrap, grilled and filled with veggies, with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Can't go wrong with that combo. It was warm and fast. Even though there wasn't much reason to (nothing to melt, nothing needed to be cooked) I'm glad I got it grilled. It seemed to help keep the wrap together as I was running down Bloor.  If you don't feel like making up a meal for yourself they also have a huge selection of ""Chef Creations"" (at least one of which is vegan)  that you can modify further if you feel like it (for an extra charge).  The other benefit to this location is that Crema Coffee is right inside, so you can get a wrap, salad, bowl, or whatever AND get a delicious cup of coffee too. And by the way, Crema has one of the best soy latte's I've had in the city... though maybe I should save that for a Crema review...  Just a note, I can never get the freshii wifi to work with my iPod Touch, but I can connect to it with my netbook. Maybe it's me, but I'm just going to blame them on this one."
truthful,"I love Shauna's!  The prices are great, Shauna is really nice and my dog has a good time playing there. Shauna is very knowledgeable and you can tell that she loves animals. If I had even the slightest notion that my dog wasn't being cared for, I wouldn't go there. It's too bad someone had a negative experience, but I've been here many times and have always seen the dogs in their care happy. I have sent many friends to Shauna's and am glad that she's so close by. I highly recommend!!!!"
truthful,"I've been going here every other week for a mani pedi for several months now.  I like the staff. They are professional and friendly. I feel comfortable there.  I like the massage chairs and the fish tank, both help me relax.  I'm a stickler for cleanliness and their tools are always sterile (autoclaved) and they use liners in their foot baths.  The service is very consistant from tech to tech, so I don't feel the need to be choosy about who does my nails.  They give a lengthier massage than most places, but I find the massages lack-luster.  That's really my only suggestion for improvement. Better massage technique.  My gel polish lasts a full two weeks and so does my pedicure (not gel).  I really like this place and will continue to treat myself to a trip to Dream Nails every other week!"
truthful,"We have visited many many times over the years.  I love the salsa.  The food is excellent and fresh.  I wish they would give out a larger bowl for the salsa since the small cups available are not easy to dip a chip in, however this is a small complaint.  The only other negative is the ""ambience,"" which is lacking. Not the most comfortable chairs.  Everything I've tried has been excellent.  The staff is friendly.  Love it!  We will continue to be regulars."
truthful,"I love Heidi's!!!  I go here often and always receive friendly service and delicious food.  My husband and kids love it too.  As many before me have said, the bread is fantastic. We buy loaves when we are there so we can enjoy it at home. I've tried the eggplant parm sandwich, egg salad, veggie, grilled veggie and a few others and all have been excellent!  I'm a vegetarian, so it's nice to have lots of choices here.  My husband has had roast beef, Italian, pastrami and other subs and has always been happy.  I send friends and family here. Everyone has been happy.  I highly recommend Heidi's!"
truthful,I came in to get some boba tea and there was a employee eating behind counter that wasn't professional. The cashier seem rude and unhelpful.
truthful,"Yesterday I had my new patient appointment with Dr. Adams. Immediately upon arriving I was happily greeted by 3 women at a side desk. They immediately informed me that the ambulance had just left and Dr Adams was a few minutes behind. This was fine with me. There were 4 patients waiting and the office was comfortable and clean. They made sure all waiting patients knew of the situation and one by one called them back. About 45 minutes later, happily to my suprise, I was already called back!  Yolanda took my weight and BP  - she was professional and kind. She did my initial intake and we had a nice laugh as well. Dr Adams was in the room in about 5 minutes! Now where do I start. Dr Adams is very professional and thorough. She was interested in my home life and even what I was reading in the office! We discussed many options of treatment for my 3 reasons of being in the office. She gave me immediate referrals and advice that I felt was not only professional but thoughtful in her answers. She even called for my bloodwork and labs right there in the office instead of sending me on a goose chase to a random lab. She related to me and understood my past with what I felt very comfortable sharing with her. I have searched for a doctor in NV for 10 yrs. I am so pleased that I actually look forward to going back to see Dr K. Adams. You are truly one of a kind Dr. Adams! God bless you!"
truthful,"Today my best friend and I went to serenity nails at 1pm. They sat us down immediately. The entire place stunk of someone's lunch. They began to fill the pedicure tubs and when we asked for it to be warmer one woman began scooping the water out (while on her cell phone and chewing with her mouth open) we sat with the running water and nobody to turn it off for 8 minutes until it began to overflow. In which we recorded this embarresment of a ""salon"" proceeded to put on our shoes and leave. The blue pedicure water covered half of the back salon and at one point another man doing a manicure stood up, observed the mess all over the flow and sat back down to the manicure lol! If I could stand on the corner directing people just a block down to Dream nails I would pay them not to step foot in this facility. What a joke!"
truthful,"Went for a special occasion and let them know in advance, asked for a nice table, we were put in a corner in a cold area was so cold my shoulders hurt and feet were like ice, when I asked to move they were reluctant even though the place was far from full, they did move us however next to a drafty door. The waiter comes out overly friendly, with phoney smile as others on the staff. The truffel soup was like a bowl of salt water.  The Pasta dish was cheap dumplings with frozen peas and 2 mexican shrimps chopped up so small and yes a lot of salt. The Salmon  was bland but the mashed cauliflower under it was salty and not cooked all the way, the broclii was burned, we left half of our meals on our plates and no one asked why? The service was horrible we constantly had to ask the bus person to find us the waiter. Way Way overpriced and an added 18% service charge for poor service. They never said, thanks good bye or come again. I read so much good about The Farms that I really wanted to go, but it is a Never Again, does not deserve a 2nd chance, $180.00 for 2 and did not eat and 2 beverages. Also my stomach was very uncomforatable from so much salt,  I felt very nausiated."
truthful,"This little coffee shop offers a great spot to meet up, have an office gathering or just sit and people watch. I felt the coffee was a bit high priced but I enjoyed the atmosphere, so it was worth it."
truthful,"This place was amazing!! It was the last restaurant my husband and I visited during our get-away. We were shocked at the quality of food for the price. Cool atmosphere and lots of quality beers to choose from. We had the brisket, hog belly, beans and the JW potatoes (I believe that's what they were called) Everything was amazing! Definitely try it out if you're in the area!"
truthful,Amazing tacos! A must try if you're in the area. Quaint place with great service! We visited before a Cav's game! Awesome location.
truthful,I had a wonderful lunch with my mother at this Bravo location. Our waitress was amazing and catered to our every need. Excellent!!
truthful,"Great service.  You feel like family as soon as you hit the door. Food was great, with a very big selection for breakfast. Owned by a Greek boy from Michigan. We will definitely be back"
truthful,I can't say enough good about this place. Oysters are always fresh and they bring in daily from both coasts. Go on a Monday and you'll get the two for one deal; that's 2 dozen for $30...wow!!! As a seafood lover it has become my favorite haunt for a great meal. My daughter (teenager ) loves their lobster poutine and I am in love with their blue crab claw butter lettuce salade with homemade butter milk dressing.
truthful,"My husband and I hired Up N Smoke for our wedding reception. They had catered my husbands work and before he even proposed he said that we should have Up N Smoke cater our wedding when that time came. SO when we were planning I made sure to hire them. I personally never tried it but I trusted my husbands tastes buds and I couldn't have been happier that we went with them. Rich was so fast to respond and to answer my questions. He was even willing to work with us around the timing of our ceremony and setting up the buffet, so we wouldn't be hearing clinging and clattering while we were saying our vows. Once everyone was served, Rich and his crew put all the left overs in tin pans and had everything cleaned up in a blink of an eye! All night I was hearing about how good the food was from all our guest, and I myself have been loving having the left overs to eat and enjoy for the last few days! I almost want to find another event soon to have to order different food from them so I can try out their whole menu!!! If you want great BBQ food, and have an amazing costumer service experience go with Rich and Up N Smoke!!"
truthful,"My wedding was just at Villa Tuscana this past weekend. I honestly couldn't say a bad thing about these wonderful people!! I was in a few times from when we booked them in July, and they were always so willing to sit down and talk to me about my worries and my questions. In the end the hall was decorated even better then I thought. They were so willing to help me and I had a lot of last minute minor changes and they were there helping me set up the room the way I wanted it to be!!!  I also love that the base price includes SO much. Most places that I was going to to have chair decorations it was going to be an extra charge. To do this centerpiece was going to be an extra charge. Villa Tuscana does have a deluxe package but the base package includes so much that if you can't afford the deluxe items you still can have a wide selection of choices! Also there are some great things that come with the package, the DJ is included, the cake is included, and the photographer is included.  I highly recommend taking a look at Villa Tuscana for any kind of big event that you need plan!"
truthful,"Great customer service! They go above and beyond with making you feel comfortable and giving you the hairstyle you ask for! Andrew did an awesome job on my husband and Mariana did an amazing job with my hair! Carlos the owner, is really sweet and makes you feel at home! Hard to trust anyone especially coming from a different state not knowing where to go! Definitely will be back!"
truthful,"I came here with expectations after reading some reviews here. I have to say the service was not as bad as I thought it would be. It is your average Asian resto service. Distant and quick. I got the pho with just the noodles and it was better than Pho Kim Long's! They do not give you a lot of mint and sprouts like Pho Kim Long but I am sure if you ask for more they will give you more. The large was not that big but it was enough for me. They have bigger bowls at Pho Kim Long. Over all I say its not bad. I will come back here just because the Pho was great. Service could be better but hey no one said you have to be happy at work. As long as they do their job right, you do not have to be my BFF."
truthful,"Service is bad, very slow. Food is meh. I do not recommend this place. I don't know how they stay open. Will not go back there unless there is no other option."
truthful,"Ok, the pho was not bad tasting at all. It was actually ok however 2 hours after I ate it I experienced dizziness and got nauseated and ill! I threw up all the food that I ate from that place. I do not now what that happened but it happened to me. The food was not bad and the waiter barely understood English. I cannot recommend this place after it made me so ill. I do not wish it on anyone. Be warned."
truthful,Service is slow! Don't bother coming here if you want to be fed. A couple of people were waiting and no one came to even get our drink order. It's not a big place so I don't know what the problem was. Really sad as I was looking forward to eating there.
truthful,I made an appointment in the morning to see Leah in the afternoon and she was able to see me right away. It was my first time at this salon and she was great! She was very good at was she does. We talked about what kind of cut I wanted and she listened and made some suggestions. I like that she was not overly chatty and she just did what she had to do which was to cut my hair. Leah did not act like she was my bff and I like that. I did not come there to chat but to get a good haircut.  Leah is skilled and knows how to cut coarse asian hair. She cut my hair just like the way I wanted it and she was so nice. The cut was for $30 which was reasonable and there was no push to sell you any shampoo or hair products which I really like. I dont like to be put on the spot after a haircut to buy hair products that I do not need. I highly recommend Leah to anyone. I am so glad to have found a great hairdresser that can cut my hair the way I want it!
truthful,"Great place! Great customer service. I checked into Yelp and got 20% off my tab. The sushi was ok, I have had better. Lots of dessert options. The food was ok. They had oysters for lunch! The place is clean and huge. I would come back here when I visit again. Recommend it anytime!"
truthful,So we went here and we had fun. We did the $20 for 1 hour and ride all the rides you want. They had about 5 to 6 rides for kids and 2 rides for adults. Its ok. It is one of those places that you go once and then thats it. he mini carts were fun but I would not do it again. I dont know why. Maybe its the smell of the fumes coming from the carts or maybe it just did not do it for me. Even our 8 yo was just ok with it. I guess it depends on how much you like mini cart rides.
truthful,"Our son loves it here! For $7 the whole family can get a great workout. The bouncers can benefit on getting some repairs but not too bad, they work. Fun, fun place! Closed for parties on the weekend and open Tue-Fri 930-1230 and 2-5pm. Call first to check the hours. Worth the trip if you want to have fun and get a work out. Dont forget socks for everyone. They are mandatory!"
truthful,"Ivy is great!  The place is clean and the techs are courteous.  The only draw back is the smell of nail salon, I dont know if it is the acetone but it is strong.  An exhaust fan or opening a door will help but with the cool air outside it might not a good idea.  Overall it was not a bad experience."
truthful,"Dr Lefever is a different type of chiropractor . No cracking, no pain or popping but effective adjustment . I highly recommend him if you are looking for a chiropractor. He is so nice, thorough and effective. His new office is located on Cheyenne and 215."
truthful,"I booked this hotel in a rush and my bad as I did not read the $18/night resort fee. Basically I paid $66/night to stay in this hotel. I would not have minded that if the hotel was just honest about it. I think that it was very sneaky for them to practice such a thing.  The resort is huge. It's like an apartment complex and since we arrived late at night the grounds were so dark it was tough to find your duplex like room. It was nice that we were connected only to another room. The grounds were clean and quiet. The bed was soft and comfy. The AC was cold and loud. It had room for 2 people and a kid. The furniture was old and the the tv in the living room and bedroom was ancient. I did not even try and use it. The in room safe actually uses a key..lol (not code).  The room has old stained carpet and the ceilings have beams. The bathroom was old and small. On our first night we actually had no hot water in our room. We showered in lukewarm water. I called the front desk to report it and the lady acted like I was bothering her. The next day at 830 am, thank God we were already awake, with our DND sign on the door we get the maintenance people at our door minimizing our no hot water complain. I insisted they check and surprise, surprise it was broken! I demanded to be moved to another room.  The man on the phone who moved us was probably the only normal person there. He was appropriate  and helpful.  The rest of the staff in this facility have no customer service skills. They just don't care.  They also put a $100 hold on your CC when you check in. I am waiting for them to remove that on my CC or I will definitely dispute it.  I would not recommend anyone to stay here. Except for the soft bed and extra pillows there is nothing here to write home about. There are a lot of other places in Scottsdale that will appreciate your business and you can get more for your money. Stay away!"
truthful,"Sushi was ok, nothing extraordinary. LIke most sushi places in LV they are owned by Korean folks, not Japanese. If you know your sushi you know it is not the same. It is ok if you want sushi on the go. Go to Raku for authentic sushi, the real Japanese style. Pricey but worth it! Make reservations ahead of time at Raku."
truthful,"$45 minus tip for 80 minutes massage! You cannot beat this price and the comfort! The therapist are graduate massage therapist waiting to take their exams. You can ask for a more experienced student when you make your appointment. CASH only place so bring your cash! It is a secret not too many people know so pass it along. The rooms are nice, big and quiet. It's like going to Massage Envy minus the high price. Check it out! Located by Regal Square above Patty's Closet."
truthful,"Great gym and  classes, equipment ! Biggest gym of all the LVAC. Bigger than 24 hour fitness ."
truthful,"Its amazing how nice this library is. Its new, it has vending machines and a lounge for you to relax in. I cannot get over the self service library check out and the electronic book return bin. Its so high tech! And they let you borrow up to 50 items! There is no place like LV!"
truthful,"I do like the Bellagio buffet. Its a toss up between Mandalay Bay and Bellagio. French food is what they say this place is about. Although I do not eat any kind of seafood I have to say they have the best selection of crab. They had the Alaskan King crab and the snow crab in buckets! This place is like crab heaven if you like crab. They have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos. I like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread. I do not eat bread although I love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that. The bread had to be tried! It was delicious, and they had real butter on the side. Soft butter, not the frozen kind. The butter was at room temperature so it was easy to spread it on your bread. Yum!   Alright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait. It felt like a line at Disneyland to get into one of those rides! The line was long! We waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside. Prepare to wait folks. It is worth the wait but do not come here starving hungry because you will wait and you will end up grouchy and impatient by the time you get to the cashier. Eat enough for about an hour wait and then be ready to feast! Happy eating1"
truthful,Great service . Jace is wonderful. The deep dish pizza is nothing like Pizza Hut but it's ok. The Caesar salad was delish. I recommend this place to anyone who likes American food .
truthful,"The ramen was good. We have been to Japan and the ramen is similar in taste. The place is busy and small like they are in Japan. I recommend getting here early and be prepared to wait if you have a big party. I like their Shoyu ramen, the gyoza was ok. I thought for $5.00 it was a bit steep. I will visit again although I am not a big fan of MSG which I know for sure they have in their broth."
truthful,"If you like personal touch and friendly service then come and check this dentist out! This office will exceed your expectations! Dr Nguyen is professional, nice and the staff is so great. If you are looking for a dentist that does not make you feel like you are one of the many clients or more like a business then come here and see what I am talking about."
truthful,Not a bad place. Food was good although the serving is not a lot which can either be taken good or bad. Service was not bad. It was bright inside which was a bit too much. I think the place would be better with better lighting IMO. Overall not bad. I would eat there if I am in the area but I won't go out of my way to eat there.
truthful,"I have been to both locations. It has that buffet atmosphere so there you go. People taking what they want and more. My hubby likes it because you get more for your money especially for dinner. They have lots of seafood and fresh oyster that I do not eat but hubby does. I like the Mongolian bbq although I had to tell the man making it to not overcook the veggies. No salad bar and some fruits. Love the baked bananas, yum! Will go back because of the mongolian bbq.  At least I can eat something here that I like. Kids are also half price, yay!"
truthful,"Very good place for kids. Informative, very cool. However for me this is one of those once in a lifetime visit deal. Would I go there again? Probably not. But it was a nice place to visit."
truthful,"This place is terrible!  One star is generous for this place. I hope the owners realize their place is a dump! The food is old and tasteless. Its messy and the restaurant is unkept. I cannot imagine what the kitchen looks like. They do have an ""A"" rating but that food is just plain bad! We used to go here years ago when it had the same reputation and quality as Asia Buffet. The place now is like the haven of people who just need something to fill their stomachs for cheap. No quality, no taste kind of food and cheap. It is sad to see what happened to the quality of this restaurant. I will never go back there unless it is a no choice kind of situation. Do yourself a favor and drive down to Asia Buffet. A few dollars more and it will be worth your time and money. There are also some very seedy characters in the resto. Bad, cheap food attracts the bad customers? lol"
truthful,Great place for kids to learn how to swim. The pool is warmer than the YMCA pool which kids love. Kids can swim year long and not be cold. When they get out of the pool the whole room is warmer and the showers are nearby. The facility is clean and the workers are friendly.  Kids learn at their own pace so don't expect your kids to be like Michael Phelps after they finish their summer classes.   I recommend year round classes if you want your child to be good at swimming. 2 months of class is not enough to make them great swimmers. I highly recommend this place for learning how to swim.
truthful,"Careful about signing up with this facility. This place is concerned about profit only (selling tshirts,pants, etc.). High pressure shady sales tactics.  They make it very hard to cancel your membership.  The owners are only concerned about making money off of you IMO. Please be advised. Learn from our experience. Stay away from this place. Very disappointing."
truthful,"I like this place. It is your usual busy Chinese restaurant. No smiling, busy, no nonsense waiters. I like their fried fresh off the fish tank flounder, mixed seafood with crispy noodles, etc. The prices are reasonable and they are open until 2am! Try and see for yourself."
truthful,"Go to Leah at this place. She is great, not a chatterbox and knows how to cut Asian hair which is hard to find in LV. Reasonable price and no pressure sales to buy products. They are close on Sundays so plan ahead."
truthful,"Sandy is a great buyers agent. She is accessible, prompt and will be an advocate for you. She goes out of her way to make things happen. She follows up and calls you or texts you back right away. I recommend her to anyone buying a home and does not know anyone. She will look out for you and be your ally. She is patient, kind and very knowledgeable with her profession. We are very lucky to have found her!"
truthful,"I read a review here so I lowered my expectations when I got there. They gave me robe and your own locker to put your things in. I was so far impressed. I did not have to wait for very long at all and my therapist got me into the nice massage room right away. My therapist was ok. She was not the friendliest although I like that she was not chatty at all. Her pressure was not that firm. I guess I could have told her to give me more pressure. No water at the end of your massage like other places. She disappeared after the massage never to be seen again...lol. The check out was interesting. There was a pimple faced teen ago boy at the desk that was not sure exactly what to say. I figured a business like this will have a receptionist all the time and not an awkward boy at the check out not knowing what to say to customers. I cannot even express anymore how weird the check out process was and the tip giving. There was no envelope to put your tip and my therapist was no where to be found! I gave her a good tip and handed it to the boy. I hope she gets it. Overall the customer service at this place is terrible. The massage was ok. I would NOT recommend this place unless you are just desperate for a massage. This place feels like these people are just going through the motions. Their hearts are not in the right place and I did not feel any pride in their work.  It is clean though, other than that..stay away."
truthful,The place is a sit down kind of restaurant . The menu is not very helpful and the food selection is limited. I am used to Filipino food places like Fiesta Filipina where you can come in and pick any food you want quickly because it's ready. I was disappointed to see that it was a sit down place. There is also a distinct smell to the place. I don't want to say it smells bad but it was noticeably present.
truthful,Sunday early morning at 130am my AC in my house broke. I called Tim and he answered my call at 130. He came in on a Sunday morning at 8am to fix my AC.  It took him less than an hour to fix my AC and charge me a reasonable price.   I highly recommend this company and Tim. Thank you so much!
truthful,Its ok. I have had better Thai food. The resto is nice inside although they are so busy. Maybe we got the wrong dishes but the dishes we had like the Thom Kha was nothing spectacular. It was average. I had high expectations because of what I heard from people but unfortunately it did not rise to the occassion.
truthful,Massage done by Joe was great! Pressure was just right and the shoulder massage was my favorite. I was not a big fan of the ionic thing but it was ok. The place was nice and quiet and they service was great. I will definitely visit again and recommend this place if you are in the area.
truthful,"My wife and I took the tour with Imbibe Tours a few days after Christmas. We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit ""homey"". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value. Those who love amazing wine, great food and education on how a winery runs will not be disappointed!"
truthful,"Best margaritas around! The food is all a la cart, which is quite different from typical Mexican fair. Very unique flavors. The place is spotless inside with some nice artwork. Definitely a go-to if you like Mexican!"
truthful,"Weekly wine tasting events give a great chance for everyone to try wines from all over the world. $5 per person gets you a tasting of 5-6 wines.   Brian is so very knowledgable about their wines and is not afraid to give you his personal opinion instead of the usual tasting notes you get from others elsewhere. I would highly recommend this place if for no other reason than the amazing selection they have from all over the world. Mentioning a varietal, appellation, region, food pairing or any other descriptor will get you a list of suggestions.   I would highly recommend working through their selections...the wine cellar has some interesting finds as well."
truthful,"My wife and I had an early dinner here on a Monday. The staff was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that the other waiter was much more interested in customer service than our waitress. Our waitress read off some specials, but we overheard the other waiter reading off a much more extensive list and go out of his way to make his diners much more comfortable.  The food was OK, but overpriced for what we received. I would not recommend getting anything with snap peas as the chef does not know to trim the stem ends off of the peas. The risotto also seems to be a favorite as it is a side with many entrees; however, it is a bit dense (Gordon Ramsey would not approve). It is very obvious that they are doing their best to make this establishment work, but I think they still need to update themselves a bit in order to draw a younger crowd. At present, it is a ""blue hair"" establishment. This may be the image they are looking to portray and clientele they are looking to attract, but the image discourages those under 40 from dining here.  I would also look to update the wine list. At present they have a wide range, but these are the very traditional and well-known mega-winery names. I would like to see some more unique items on the list."
truthful,"This stop is a gem on the strip. Situated on the second floor of the Cromwell hotel across Las Vegas Blvd from Caesar's Palace, The view is excellent. Depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the Bellagio fountain show. The service was a bit slow and we spent roughly 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table, but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay. We were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion, we brought our own bottle of wine. The corking fee was a bit high (but not for Vegas prices) at $35, but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine. Once we ordered, our food came out exceptionally fast. We highly recommend the baked pasta of the day, the Buratta cheese (buffalo mozzarella), Baby Sweet Peppers and Marinated Olives. Our total dining experience lasted over 1 1/2 hrs. We were so fulfilled by the time we left. In the end, when our check came, we found that the corking fee was not on it. This may have been due to the fact that we bought so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply forgot, but we weren't complaining :)   I would highly recommend Giada's for lunch!  All their food is fresh and homemade, which is somewhat rare these days, even on the strip."
truthful,"One of the best places in Tempe to get a late-night snack that isn't horrible for you.  I'm guilty of not always (or even usually) going with the most healthy options, but the sheiftalia platter has got to be better for me than a burger and fries, right?  Their tzaziki is bomb, the sheiftalia is delicious and tender and juicy and coated in just the right amount of lemon-y-ness, and their pitas are thick and soft, the way they should be.  They're open 'til 3:30 AM, and they deliver.  If you love good food and like to eat at weird hours of the night, do it here.  You won't regret it."
truthful,"This is the some of the yummiest Chinese food I've had since moving to AZ, and absolutely the yummiest Chinese delivery I have had since moving here.  I've only found three or four places total that have delivered, and all of them have been mediocre or worse, except for Asia Lee.  Everything I've gotten from them is delicious; last time I ordered Szechuan Beef, Pork Egg Foo Yung, and the free Chicken Fried Rice that comes with any order of $15 or more.  I wasn't a huge fan of the pork that came with the Egg Foo Yung, but the egg patties themselves are savory and delightful.  The Szechuan Beef is my absolute favorite, and it made a great lunch when I reheated it the next day, as welll.  I've never been inside the restaurant, so I can't vouch either way for the last review, but honestly, why would I go to the restaurant when I can have all the yumminess delivered right to my door?"
truthful,"Okay, so I might be a total weirdo, but I wake up craving Pei Wei's fried rice some days.  There is very little I enjoy more than waking up hungry at 10 AM on one of my days off, logging on to Pei Wei's website, and ordering fried rice just the way I like it without having to explain it to anyone and risk them writing it down wrong.  I'm antisocial, so what?  Then, I know that when they open at 11 AM they will have my very special order of fried rice hot and ready waiting for me.  The portions are huge, so a $6-$7 order of fried rice can last me up to four meals, which is an awesome [if not exactly healthy] deal.    I don't really like much of their other food that I've tried.  There's some sort of curry dish that was nice, but I'm sticking to my fried rice with extra egg...  yum."
truthful,"Their specials menu is extremely misleading -- I went there on a Wednesday, and according to the menu you get ""50 cent drafts with any entree.""  So I ordered an entree and asked what they had on draft.  Apparently that wasn't specific enough, because my beers were $5 a pop.  The waitress played dumb, and when I spoke to a manager he treated me like an idiot for not asking for the ""draft specials"" rather than the drafts.  That language is nowhere on the menu.  He told me if I didn't want to pay that much, ""we were going to have a problem.""  He didn't even offer any sort of discount or anything, claiming that ""he didn't write the menu.""  I paid and left, and I'll never go back, simply because they're purposefully misleading and expect their drunk customers not to ask questions at the end of the night.   Also, the stalls in the women's restroom have no locks.  Charging five bucks for a plastic cup of beer, they should be able to afford to get that fixed."
truthful,"This is my go-to bar.  I'm not into the scene at places where there's a lot of loud, obnoxious frat boys.  Four Peaks isn't especially quiet, mind you.  They play pretty good music for the most part, and almost every time I've started to groan because of the song that just came on, someone who works there changes it.  The service is a little slow, usually, but I honestly don't care.  The food is amazing, and the beer...  oh, the beer.  I love the Sunbru for warmer days, and the Oatmeal Stout when its chillier out.  I always end up drinking a little more than I planned because they're so delicious, and that leads to me splurging on appetizers.  My favorite is the spinach artichoke dip.    All of their beers are worth trying, since they brew them there you're not going to get them anywhere outside of AZ, as far as I'm aware.  If you don't know where to start, for $9 you can order the sampler, and get a tiny glass of each kind of beer they brew, then decide for yourself.    Short version: good food, good beer, one-of-a-kind establishment, go, now."
truthful,"Me and a friend ordered delivery through GrubHub, which was fine.  The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple.   My friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.  I am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment.   For a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed. Worst $50 I've ever spent on a meal."
truthful,"I love Dutch Bros!  I'm a dedicated punch-card holder, addicted to iced Kickers, which are their Irish-cream flavored specialty.  They're really rich though, just so you know what you're getting into before you take my advice.  They make it with cream, but you can also get it with less fatty milks (or soy milk).  If you want the full experience, get the cream though.    I also love that their prices are all in increments of $0.25, including tax.  It's just a nice touch.  :)"
truthful,"Oh, what a wonderful experience.    My boyfriend and I were going a little nuts on Groupon yesterday (I think we purchased 3 different deals) when we discovered a Groupon Now! for Thai Buffet.  My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.  We were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.  My favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than ""restaurant-y,"" for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.  As we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.  Definitely will be back.  You get a great value for the price (even without a Groupon, the buffet is $9.99/person), with quality eats and very friendly service."
truthful,"My main problem with the Cornish Pasty Company is inconsistency.  I've had pasties that were simply divine, and I kept going back.  Once I started getting ones that were a little icky, I just assumed they were having an off day.  I stopped going after my boyfriend and I got sick.  I really want to like this place, and I do like some things about it.  The crust on the pasties is always fab, but the fillings are hit or miss.  I always got either the Oggie or the Pilgrim, and the Oggie was more consitently good.  Once I tried the Pilgrim, it became my instant favorite since is had turkey and stuffing inside, and came with cranberry sauce for dipping.  But like I said, their lack of consistency, as well as the fact that I got sick last time I went, has made me not want to give them any more chances."
truthful,"My boyfriend and I are super broke right now, so we're taking advantage of our Groupon credits.  We were hungry, and 5 & Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.  As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well.    As a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about."
truthful,"The employees are for the most part very friendly, and right now they've got some sweet deals going on for candy.  2 sodas, 2 candies, and a popcorn for $5, or 1 soda, 1 candy, and 1 popcorn for $3.  Plus they give out free gift cards for pre-ordering movies and games.    They also have a new thing called Direct Access, where if there's a movie or game title that they don't have in the store, they can have it mailed to you within 2-3 business days for the same price as renting it in the store.  You can mail it back when you're done, or bring it back to the store for $3 off a movie rental or $4 off a game rental.  Sweeeet."
truthful,"I am addicted to Venezia's.  A while back, a coworker picked up a slice for me and I was not impressed.  I don't know what was wrong with me.    I re-tried Venezia's on my lunch break four days ago, and I have eaten there every day since.  I brought my boyfriend there, and he is obsessed as well.  I am boring and usually just get cheese pizza, but my boyfriend always gets the slice of the day and raves about it, whatever it is.  I also got the Combo B last night, a slice of pizza with a small salad and a drink, and the salad was impressively good.  The Balsamic dressing was excellent, too.  Everyone should try this place out.  The pizza slices are huge, delicious, and satisfying."
truthful,"I crave Ono from time to time.  I wish it was closer to my apartment.  I still swing by for some Chicken Katsu whenever I get the chance, because it is tasty and delicious and katsu sauce is addictive.  My boyfriend is more adventurous than me, and he literally always is in the mood to go here.  He especially enjoys the spare ribs, bbq combo, and the spam musubi.  We both love the macaroni salad...  I get why someone said there was too much mayo, and I guess by some standards it's a little plain, but that's what I like about it.  People who say the rice is boring are obviously right, but they're forgetting to put soy sauce or katsu sauce or whatever they want on it.  It's plain white rice, guys, what do you think it's going to taste like?    They also have these super tasty canned Hawaiian beverages at the counter that we both highly recommend.    Oh, and if you have a smaller appetite, definitely go for the smaller plate option.  My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach and I can never finish the full-sized katsu plate, but the smaller one is just right (actually still a little more than I can eat, usually) and it's only about $5.  Awesome."
truthful,"Amazing wine list, fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings, and gnutella crepes for dessert.  It doesn't get any better.  Not to mention that the service is excellent and friendly, and the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming, something that you don't usually experience in a place as hip as Cibo.  I get nervous going out to trendy places because I'm scared of getting dirty looks from rich people, but this was not my experience at Cibo.  Just sitting on their patio is a relaxing experience, what with the lovely foliage, glass of wine, and beardy waiter.  I always want to go back when I've got the cash.  Great for a date or special event."
truthful,"Today was my second or third time coming to Paradise, but I wouldn't call it that if I had a choice.  I ordered the Chicken Katsu, which is a favorite of mine when it comes to Hawaiian food.  I was disappointed that it was especially chewy, and that they served it with BBQ sauce instead of Katsu sauce.  It just didn't taste quite right.  The lady working there wasn't particularly friendly, either.  I'll just go to Ono next time I hear the call of Katsu."
truthful,"I am a couscous addict, and this is my go-to place.  Everything I've tried here is wonderful, though, and I love the attached market."
truthful,"Best. French Fries.  Ever.  Also they have great onion rings, fried zucchini, hot dogs...  I don't eat burgers really, so I can't speak to those.  I am obsessed with their tuna salad, though.  I never thought I'd be ordering tuna salad sandwiches regularly from anywhere.  Tuna salad has a tendency to be that unpleasant gray or pinkish color, and have a tinge of fishiness to it, if its not fresh enough.  That is never the case at Chicago Hamburger Co.  This might sound strange, but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color I have ever seen.  It's because they put relish in it.  Lots of delicious relish.  I am in love with their sandwiches, and although I used to devoutly order Polish sausages & fries, I can't turn my back on my new love.  Not the first thing people think of ordering when they come here, but it's definitely worth a try."
truthful,"Same deal as everyone else.  I bought the LivingSocial deal, and emailed them through their website as soon as I got the voucher.  I never got a reply, but I didn't mind because the instructions DID say to call a specific number to schedule, as opposed to going through their website.  About a week after my initial email, I called and left a voicemail at the number listed on the voucher.  Never got a call back.  Today, my boyfriend called to try and schedule a cleaning and the number on the voucher is no longer in service.  Their website has also been disabled.  I've requested a refund from LivingSocial."
truthful,"I was here for a conference in April, and this was probably the most beautiful hotel I've stayed in. The staff and service was wonderful, and the provided food was more than satisfactory. Wi-Fi was a decent speed (except in the lobby), and was free to members who join their loyalty program.  The main issue I had was with the room I stayed in the first night. It faced another room, and therefore didn't have much natural light. I also couldn't leave the curtains open if I wanted privacy. The worst part was the noise. There was a low pitched humming from air conditioning equipment outside the room. The noise wasn't incredibly loud, but it was very grating and made it difficult to get work done or sleep.   The next day, I asked for a new room. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and did not make me feel like a nuisance. I got a room that was much quieter, faced the street instead of another room, and had better natural light. I just wish this was true for all the rooms.  Overall, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for the first room, and 4 stars for the second room."
truthful,"Tried out this new location, and wow! Amazing. I will be back for sure! Everyone is so friendly and service is spot on. Our meal was delicious and the music was great. Can't wait to try more things on the menu! This place is a winner!"
truthful,"Went to Wally's last night and all I can say is YIKES!!!!! The biggest disappointment I've experienced in a long time. What used to be this hidden gem, with the comfort of home vibe with perfectly cooked home cooked food and staff that treated you like family has now become just like every other restaurant in Scottsdale. Way over priced for poor quality of food, staff that doesn't care anymore, management that doesn't care anymore. My favorite waitress is gone, which I guess is no surprise seeing what the owner Chris did to this place. If I wanted to eat at Grassroots or Twisted Grove then I would drive a few blocks down and eat there. Wally's was something amazing, something special that is so hard to find in a restaurant these days.Now, it's ruined, now is disgusting, now it's a complete waste of your time and hard earned money. Don't bother trying it out, trust me. I will not be back to this one. I would much rather drive to the other location on Camelback that has remained the old Wally's. Way worth the drive."
truthful,"I came into Wally's  last night for dinner with my wife and another couple. We were seated at a large round table in the corner on the patio. Our server Candy was amazing! What a gem she is. I have never had a more remarkable server. Seated next to us was a very large rambunctious group of ladies (if I can even call them ladies). The disgusting display of disrespect towards Candy was something I have never seen before. They were behaving like they were in a night club and to watch them bark orders at her and to treat her as if she was a slave to them was horrifying. But even more astonishing was how Candy carried herself through it all. That smile never left her face. I hope those women wake up today feeling completely ashamed of themselves, especially the one who did all of this in front of her teenage sons. I hope I never see any of the women in Wally's again and no server here ever has to go through what Candy went through."
truthful,Place was old looked dirty so I didn't bother ordering. I value my health so I won't eat there
truthful,They do a bad job of repairing flats. They'll probably make you get a new tire and that's expensive but the worst thing is the tire will more than likely have a slow leak meaning you'll probably be going back again and wasting more time. That is what happened to me.
truthful,Last few times I made the mistake of  Using beck and not city taxi. Beck taxied smell bad and the drivers don't seem to know the city well. I won't be using them any time soon.
truthful,"Just go.  Unbelievable duck tacos, sublime filet (really how does one make onion rings so good you want more? same for the grits, good grits-WTF?).  Fiance said lamb was so good she didn't know that lamb was supposed to taste like that.  Service great, attentive without being a pain.  Sit outside if you can, inside is noisy and small but smells really good as the kitchen is pretty open (no doors between it and dining).  This was top 3 in my memorable dining experience. ( Everyone has a bad day I guess, hence some of the bad reviews, but go. )"
truthful,"Great French cooking, cozy atmosphere, reasonably priced. Highly recommended."
truthful,"We love Shauna's doggy day care! It's close to home, and her hours are convenient. And she offers half day services which are quite useful when you just need to run a few errands but don't want a crazy puppy on your hands when you get home! She has supplies, but we haven't bought anything yet, although we plan too. Also offers grooming service, which we haven't used either, but will in the future."
truthful,"This place is as good as they say it is, and more. We've been there twice. Once with another couple who were grumpy about the whole experience and thus made our experience less than par. We were expecting the wait, but they were still irritated about it. They weren't nice to the staff, the staff thus wasn't nice to us.   However, the pizza is absolutely amazing. So, we went back a second time, just me and my husband. Our experience was much more delightful. We enjoyed a bottle of wine during our three hour wait (and therefore were not drunk as one reviewer suggests) and excellent conversation. The ambiance is wonderful. The staff was very friendly since we were friendly to them. We were not rushed to eat quickly, although the pizza is so good it is hard not to shovel it in your mouth! Overall, we were quite pleased and look forward to going again.   I'm not sure how one reviewer said it cost her $70 for her meal. Pizza's are $10 to $12, I'm sure soda isn't all that expensive, and salads range from $6-9. Must have left a pretty good tip!   We've had the Biancoverde and Rosa, as well as the Spiedini for an appetizer. Delish. I just love this place and wish I could go more often. It's how pizza should be made!"
truthful,"I love local business. Especially when they have great customer service like Toshi's!   I too have had the green tea smoothie, and what a delightful treat it was! I've also had their blended coffee, and iced coffee. Both far exceed the quality of that ""S"" coffee place. What's so great about the blended drinks at Toshi's is that they *shock* actually blend all the ice!! At the ""S"" place, I usually have chunks of ice at the bottom which greatly annoys me. Not so at Toshi's! And they always toast the bagels, which is great. They have limited outdoor seating, and they don't mind if you bring your well-behaved dogs.   Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the most important part....they roast their own coffee on site!!! So you know that you are getting very fresh coffee. And you can tell....the taste is so smooth and not even a little bitter.   Now what are you waiting for? You know you want to go to Toshi's!"
truthful,"Paradise is good. Wildflower is better. But there is no Wildflower in Surprise, so Paradise it is!   As others have said, the tomato soup is quite delicious. I'm also a big fan of the salad with cranberries....but the name escapes me right now. The turkey wrap is average...lacking flavor. The breakfast quiche is also average. I think mine had been sitting out for a while, so maybe a fresh one would taste better? Cookies are good, but it is hard to screw up cookies.   The salads are gigantic. Seriously, who needs a salad that big? I guess if you want it for lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day, what a deal!   It can be a bit confusing the first time you are there since there are two lines, but you figure out that one is for the bakery, one is for the rest of the food, cafeteria style.  Why do I like Wildflower better? I think their sandwiches are better, and the soup as well. The only soup I like at Paradise is the tomato soup. The others are lacking. I need flavor! I like the ambiance at Wildflower better too, although there is much more seating at the Surprise Paradise vs the Goodyear Wildflower.   Overall, not a bad place to get a fresh salad for lunch."
truthful,"I should have read reviews before heading here. I had heard from several folks that this was a good place to eat, and we had heard that the wings were out of this world. Yeah, not quite.  First of all, the ambiance is not that great. Lots of small, loud children.   The service was very average. We had three servers ask us if we had been helped yet, which I suppose is a good thing, but they all seemed very confused and not sure if we were their table. But good that they asked. Our actual server took quite a while to greet us, and of course he forgot my water. Brought the beer though!   We started with wings and we wanted to split them...two flavors. At first he told us we couldn't do that, even though it says right on the menu that you can. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by splitting them for us! They tasted more like chicken fingers and not wings. Way too much breading.   I had the California burger, hubby had the fish and chips. The burger was overdone, but I expected it would be so I ordered it medium to get it to medium well. It was well done. Thankfully I didn't order well done! Otherwise it wasn't bad for this kind of place. I also order the potato chips as a side since they make them there. The chips were burnt.  The fish was seriously over breaded (apparently they like doing that here) and way too big. The baked potato and cole slaw...very average.   Now all that being said.....our bill was very cheap ($33) and that included two beers, wings, and two entrees.   Want cheap food and average service? Go here! Otherwise, try somewhere else."
truthful,"We went here for a belated Valentine's dinner. It was fantastic. Parking was a pain, but we eventually found a spot. They seated us immediately (we had reservations) and our server was very attentive. They immediately brought out bread (delish) and water. Not long after, our wine arrived. Speaking of wine, don't be scared when you see the wine list...I didn't see any wines by the glass, only bottles, so I simply told the server what I wanted, and there it was!   I had the tagliatelle (sp?) pasta with wild mushrooms. SO good. I'm a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess, and this hit the spot. Why can't I do this at home?? Oh, and the soup... divine! The special was potato and leek soup. Perfectly smooth, must have been strained several times to get it this smooth. Very comforting. Hubby had the mac & cheese for an ap...YUM! That Vermont cheddar is just too good! He had the pork chop for his entree, and I will never be able to make pork chops at home again. Oh well! He thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert we had the Iron Chef apples, which were perfect. We were pretty full by this point, but these three adorable little tasty apples were just the right finishing touch.  The second best part of our night (the food was first, of course) was meeting Mark Tarbell! I tried not to act like a fool, but I watched him on Iron Chef, so it was cool to meet him! He was very friendly, very down to earth, and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience. He was walking around to all the tables...great chef!   So for a nice night out, you can't beat this place. Enjoy!"
truthful,"We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great.   I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience."
truthful,"Mmmmm.......bread......  Oh, sorry, I'm supposed to be writing a review. Wildflower is easily our favorite place for lunch, and breakfast too. This place is always clean, always busy, and ordering is always easy.   We usually get the same thing every visit, since it is so tasty. We both get the potato cream cheese soup, no matter what time of year (yes, it is that good!), I get the chicken and feta, and hubby gets the BLT. Even at half size, these sandwiches are plenty to fill up on. And, if we feel we can spare the extra calories, we will get a cupcake to go. YUM! I've also had a salad, can't recall which one, but it was fantastic as well. Sometimes we'll also get a loaf of bread to go, and we've varied the kind, all have been great.  Now breakfast...ah, that was just divine. I got the lemon ricotta melt in your mouth pancakes with fruit topping. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! And I got the apple sausage on the side. It was a little dry, but no matter since I was so full on the pancakes. All I needed was a mimosa.... Moving on, hubby got the banana walnut pancakes, which werer also oh so scrumptious.   So, we love supporting this place, and think it kicks Paradise's butt. We are wishing and praying that they would bring one to Surprise, although that might not be good for my waistline...."
truthful,"I love the ice cream here! Course, I've never seen baby roaches, thankfully. While the place isn't spotless, it is clean. I love the decor... very charming, and the employees are always friendly. I've had shakes and sundaes here, both have been very good. Also, they sell ""pup cups""...a frozen yogurt treat for your four legged kids! My dogs love these pup cups, and at $1.25....it's a great treat for them when it is so hot out! And it is a local store...so all the more reason to support it!"
truthful,"I've been to Babbo's several times since it is so close to my house. My two favorites are the Pasta Martini and the Gorgonzola Salad. The bread is excellent, and I've had no issues with the wine, so maybe I've been lucky? I've also had their pizza, I can't recall which one, but it was excellent with peppers and goat cheese. The ambiance is great as well, and prices are very reasonable. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service has been sketchy at times. But, it isn't so bad that we won't return. Overall, a good place."
truthful,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I love the concept, but the owner seems to only provide good customer service to his ""important"" customers. I've been in here several times, and each time I felt as though he didn't really want us there. My dogs are well behaved, and I've promoted his ice cream socials (and told him so) but I still felt as though I was not welcomed. I may not be as regular as some customers, but I still deserve good customer service. I'm not willing to pay high prices if I don't get good treatment. I want to support his business since he is local, but apparently he doesn't want my business."
truthful,"We checked this place out to compare prices to Target and other grocery stores. What I found....prices are essentially the same. Since I enjoy shopping at Target so much more (it is my happy place!) I will continue to shop at Target and the grocery store closer to my house. The good points....It is clean and well organized, and in the frozen section the lights don't come on unless you are standing in front of it. Nice touch...keeps the food in a dark cold area, while conserving energy. But, Walmart just isn't my thing, and if the prices aren't cheaper, then off to Target I go!"
truthful,"We've only had Bronoc's once. We had it delivered, and it was average pizza. The sauce was too thick and too much tomato flavor, the crust was average as well. It tasted more like certain chain pizza stores that I avoid, but it is a step up from them since their cheese tasted better. But I am a major pizza addict (usually make my own) so I am very particular. Their customer service was good, and the pizza was hot when it arrived, but the taste just wasn't that great. It's been a while since we tried, maybe we'll try again sometime and see if it has improved."
truthful,"Ok, so service isn't always the best. The workers can often be clueless and even rude. Luckily, I know Target very well, so I don't need these workers! I can find it myself! The cashiers are hit and miss. Sometimes they don't even mutter ""hello"", but whatever, I'm at Target. Yeah, it's my happy place. They always have fun stuff and great prices. Things are always well stocked (at least the workers have that part figured out). I can easily drop $100 here even though I just went in for toothpaste. How? It's one of the mysteries of the world, I suppose. So when I'm trying to save money, I don't go here! If I really need something, I do not, repeat, do not get a cart, but a basket! That way I can't fit much in my basket.   I think Target is a girl thing. Guys don't really get it. But if you are a girl, you get it. It's Target."
truthful,"We've been to Tokoyo lobby twice. Both times were great. I'll start by saying I gave it four stars instead of five because it is small, small, small inside and the ambiance isn't fantastic. But the things you must do for good sushi!   I can't recall for certain the name of our favorite roll, but I believe it was the Glendale roll. Deep fried goodness is all I can say! I know, it isn't traditional sushi, but I just can't do raw fish! Nuff said. We tried two other kinds which were good as well, but the deep fried goodness overshadowed the other ones and I have erased them from my memory.   The pot stickers were ok, not fabulous. The green tea was great and came in cute little tea pots. I haven't had sake here and I don't know why, since I usually get sake. Guess I'd better head back for some more sake and sushi!"
truthful,"Vogue Bistro is by far the best restaurant in Surprise! Why, you ask? Oh so many reasons! Let's begin...  1) It is not a chain restaurant! It is locally owned by a well trained chef.   2) The Food. Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic.   3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.  4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...  5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.  6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise.   Ok, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion.   1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation.   2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there.   So there you go. The best restaurant in Surprise....you will wonder what the heck it is doing in Surprise. It is more Scottsdale-like, but without the snobbiness (no offense to you Scottsdale folk!)."
truthful,"Ok, normally I like to support local over big chains, but I've always had a good experience at this PetSmart. The cashiers are always friendly, the store is clean, and most of the time I can find what I need (minus one time they were out of vitamins). I wish they had more organic and natural products, but since I feed my dogs mostly fresh food, this isn't an issue. They have a great selection of holiday items, so I am looking forward to what they have this year! And I've had no problem returning items if I needed to. Plus, they have adoption drives!"
truthful,"We absolutely love Sprouts! We shop here almost exclusively (only at other stores for things that we can't get or the price is too high to justify...but that includes very few items). The produce is always fantastic (and cheap!!), then meat is so tasty and fresh, and the cheese....oh I just love the cheese section! The cheese is cheaper than what you will find at other grocery stores...we did a price comparison. I know when I shop at Sprouts I am not getting overly processed, full of preservatives. I am getting fresh food!! What a concept, huh? And the bulk section is fantastic. I love being able to buy spices and flour and anything else you can think of (especially the chocolate covered toffees!!) in just the amount I need. Then it is always fresh and I don't have to wonder how long I've had that dried rosemary! And, it is a local Arizona store, which makes me even happier."
truthful,"I went to Tomo with a very large group (around 18 folks, we had a reservation). Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident.   Moving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough.   Bottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip."
truthful,"He did good work on my SV650 ABS, General maintenance and handle bar conversion.  Planning on getting more work done in the future."
truthful,"Not for me.  They sit you on a recliner, wet your feet while massaging your head (felt like they were shampooing me) -- very uncomfortable position for my back.    Then the masseusse asks you to turn over while fully reclining the chair and works your back with the elbows.   I did not like it at all, felt like it was too rough on me and am already showing a couple of bruises.  I paid $36 for the 1 hour including 30 minutes back massage.   Too loud, no privacy, cells ringing, employees talking in a foreign language, just too disturbing and I also have a headache now.  I am an expert on Swedish and Thai massages, on a massage table with the masseuse using her hands and a complete silent environment but this was a far cry from relaxing.  The masseusse was a sweet lady but the experience was not good at all"
truthful,"This place is a train wreck. The owner and management should be embarrassed to have such an under trained staff. Also the quality of food is all over the place, sometimes good and sometimes horrible. It's really sad how often we go someplace else just because of the low quality and horrible costumer service when it could all be fixed so easily. Boooooo"
truthful,Just had a great experience with Ronald. He showed right when they said he would and told us exactly what was wrong with our oven. Very fair price in a very timely manner also extremely polite and friendly. Like all the other reviews I highly recommend Absolute and will call them any time I need a appliance repaired.
truthful,Vape street is the hottest stop to vape at in Vegas good looking out on mods and juices thanks vape street lv
truthful,"Awesome taco shop! Great food, very clean, and really friendly staff. Lengua, pastor, asada, and tripas tacos very delicious!! Will definitely come back."
truthful,"Staying at Best Western and just wanted to walk to find a neighborhood restaurant. Turned down 7th street and found Laurier. I has their special of cod, three shrimp, mashed potatoes and veggies. My dinner was excellent. My husband has a lobster ravioli and loved his dinner. Our creme br√ªl√©e was outstanding. The service by Milan (?) was of the most outstanding. We are going back."
truthful,"when i called them and asked for the rate they mentioned it as 1.95 but they charged me 4.50 for each shirt,which is so ridiculous..and the lady over the counter is not even answering my question which is so irritaing.."
truthful,Used them for twice to take us to airport. Booked online the day before. morning 0700 and Muktar was on time both times. Car seat was in back. No chitchat all business. Perfect.
truthful,"STAY AWAY!!  The food was absolutely some of the worst I've eaten.  There is nothing Japanese about the cuisine.  Meat either overcooked or heated in a microwave.  Steak, chicken and shrimp with rubber consistency.  Vegetables overcooked.  Sushi didn't appear to be fresh.......Everything thrown in the garbage.  Wasted money!!"
truthful,"One of the best restaurants in Dane county and certainly the best restaurant in Sun Prairie. Friendly staff, charming space, and extensive menu.  Respect for ingredients is paramount. Always a good choice."
truthful,The steak is really good here and I have to come back once again before I finished my trip in Montreal.
truthful,"got take out. nothing to write home about. i guess everything is relative, but this food was less than mediocre... sorry."
truthful,"The food was AMAZING! I got the steak ""hand-held"" with a homemade bleu cheese sauce. It was unbelievable and the beer selection was great. If you get Mac and cheese and like heat, try adding just a touch of siracha sauce, two-thumbs up. The plates were moderately priced but a little steep if you were expecting pub prices, $14 for my sandwich. Good for me though I had bet my friend before we went in about the quality of food and I WON!! the food was great, wish I had a local bar like that in my neighborhood"
truthful,Giving a star cause I have too. Sat for 15 min and wasn't even acknowledged. I told the manager and it seemed like he didn't care. I got out of there. Horrible customer service.
truthful,"Truly the most horrific customer service I have EVER experienced in retail. Their return policy is horrible, everyone in the store acts like you are inconveniencing them by being there, and their store manager was so incredibly rude and unhelpful. I bought three expensive pieces of furniture for my new home, and every single one of them was broken in the box or was not constructed properly to put together. I will never shop here again."
truthful,I saw the reviews and came to this place Idk If these people ever ate good Thai food but this was the worst Thai food we ever had..the meat and veggies were stale no wonder they were so quick..
truthful,Nice place for casual Italian. Food is always good and they give you massive portions. All the staff have always been really friendly and quick with service.
truthful,"The food is good. The service has never been slow for us. It's great Pad Thai, Curries, etc. If you're looking for Thai food, and you're in Robinson, this is it."
truthful,"Kiyoshi is always a good place if you're in the mood for sushi. Place is nice if you go in person, or they deliver which is even better. We've always had excellent food from them."
truthful,"This was ok. Not great but not horrible either. The sushi is good for a sushi fix, but I don't think it's as fresh as Saga normally is. The service was bad. I'm sure it was our section or something. But two tables that were seated after us were served before us. We're not that picky so it didn't bother us too bad, but it was at least 10 minutes before we got drinks. Other than that, if you're looking for a chain sushi place to get some ok food that will hold you over then this is good for that."
truthful,This place has been a fantastic find for us in Moon! Pizza is awesome. Better than the other options around here. Same with the other pasta dishes. We would highly recommend this place. Delivery is quick. We've always been happy!
truthful,"Selma's is really good, not BBQ pit-masters great, but very good for Pittsburgh. The pulled pork is fantastic. I highly recommend the Big Pig Wrangler (add a hot sausage to the pulled pork sandwich)! I see other reviews looking for BBQ perfection and this isn't it. But if you're craving some BBQ and living or visiting here in Pittsburgh, this place will do the trick."
truthful,"This is my favorite place to eat real breakfast. No fake eggs. No garbage Sysco food. They have excellent pancakes and change them up throughout the seasons. The owner is fantastic. The food is fantastic. What else can I say!? The only bad thing is if you're not there early, prepare to wait because its tiny inside and everyone wants to eat there."
truthful,"I can't believe there's no other reviews on here for Hometown! This is the best pizza in the Moon area period. They are the go-to for us when we want awesome pizza. We do like some of the other options around here as well, but Hometown Pizza is by far the family favorite."
truthful,These guys are awesome very nice and polite. Found out that last time I replaced my windshield through safelite they had broke the trim panels never told me about it ( I had gone to them on 4 separate  occasions all 4 times there was always something wrong). The guys here at advantage pointed it out to me and got me some new ones and put them on for me. Can't say enough good things about advantage not pushy in anyway nice and quick will be taking my car to them for now on. And I will be telling friends and family about them. Thanks again guys!
truthful,"Been here a couple times now. I always have Dany cut my hair she is awesome very nice and easy to talk to and she knows what she is doing. I trust her 100% with my hair. Everyone that works here is great, everyone is nice makes for a great atmosphere. I live all the way in east Mesa it's worth the drive to come all the way to Lady Janes in Chandler."
truthful,"Studio 3-26 was a great salon for my 13 year old niece! She wanted to go short and that's exactly what she received! Karen was her stylist and she was phenomenal! Very welcoming and sweet towards my niece! However, when we walked in another stylist was dying her hair and her kids and significant other were receiving haircuts from here when clients were waiting. A bit of time passed and all of a sudden another stylist started to fix his own hair up. So at this time, 2 stylists were doing their own hair. As time goes on, the male stylist starts to smoke his E-Vape IN THE STUDIO!!! The work they do is quite incredible, however they need to work on professionalism."
truthful,The most excellent golf instructor is Shane Crosley. His goal is to make you the best golfer you can be. Within one lesson you'll be able to see an improvement in your game. Since I've been working with Shane I have improved every part of my game from driving to putting. He can help in anything you need to work on. Shane has great teaching  techniques that will help help fix anything.  Shane has been the BEST  addition to my game. He could be part of yours too.
truthful,"Out of convenience while staying at the Wekopa hotel, my wife and I dined at the Ahnala Mesquite Room thinking it a risk based on some negative Yelp reviews.  My wife had the Halibut and I had the Filet Mignon we both found our meals delicious, flavorful with a flair, and served hot!   The artisanal dinner rolls were piping hot and we particularly enjoyed the seeded rolls.  My Filet was well seasoned and covered with blue cheese crumbles that I crave.  The hollandaise sauce for the Filet and asparagus was a nice addition.  If you are nearby, take a risk but know that our gamble paid out a jackpot of a meal."
truthful,"What a disappointment!  Bought a water lily on Mother's Day and it's not growing.  When I called about the guarantee, was told I never should have planted it that early so the guarantee is void.  When I bought the lily, specifically asked the clerk if it was OK to plant that day and he said it was.  Now they won't replace the plant because I should have known not to plant so early.  Tricker's, really?   They're living up to their name."
truthful,"Absolute worst nail salon experience of my life, I will never go back. I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt ""oops"" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say ""that's not almond"" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says ""hurry up"" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies ""oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though"" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right. As a bonus not even two weeks later I had a nail break off, ridiculous."
truthful,Excellent food and service very friendly servers would seriously recommend the tuna chips and soft buns.
truthful,The desserts were OK. The thing I doubted was they said they serve desserts with fresh fruit but my mango sago tasted like frozen mango. It's was sweet but I can tell from the texture of the mango that it's frozen before.
truthful,"Found the best scarf of my LIFE here! Which I've since lost, but everytime I'm in Phoenix or Wherever there's a Buffalo Exchange I like to stop in just for fun!"
truthful,"Very clean and I love the snack/food options. Makes it an easy stop for road trips. I just so happened to buy something a month past expiration so that was a little disappointing, but I guess it's my own fault for not checking. Other than that I have no complaints."
truthful,Good food and the manager there rocks. She walked around and made it a point to talk to everyone. The building however can get a little crowded but it's a hotspot for Gilbert so it's to be expected. Overall it's a cute place to take the family!
truthful,The technicians are all very kind and friendly. The building is spacious and clean. I always get my puppy's nails trimmed here and I haven't been disappointed. Would recommend!
truthful,"What appeared to be a minor fender bender turned into a bit more. I originally took my vehicle to the insurance company recommended collision 'experts' and was told it would be $600.00. Figuring this was ridiculously low I took it to Sudden where they concluded the damage was more extensive and proved it to the insurance company (over $2000). They treated me how a customer should be with patience, respect and excellent service...from taking me to the car rental company and waiting until I had the key in my hand to a excellent repair with a extra repair throw in at no charge."
truthful,Went with my daughter tonight and was refused due to her under the age of 21. Both employees were very gracious in explaining the NV law and offered for us to wait in the foyer if we wanted something to go (which we didn't). A few other reviews mention the smoky atmosphere which it true but again not there fault since that's there decision on how they have licensed there business. Vegas could use a family friendly Stieners because there food is consistently excellent (on all my previous visits).
truthful,If you want a good Margarita you will love this place and their Guac live is really good too....I agree with the other the food needs some help but if you like Margarita's and Chips and Salsa this is the place to go...
truthful,"One night i was craving pizza ""chicago style"" and remembered driving by this pizza place and it had recently opened.  There were quite a few cars there so i decided to stop and give it a try.  It is very nicely decorated, staff greeted us right away.  There are TV's in each booth so you feel like your at home.  The Pizza was to die for, we absolutely loved it and it is now our weekly stop.  You won't be disappointed!"
truthful,"This was the worst Smoothie i have ever had....runny, no flavor and overpriced for what you get... Don't bother...Save your money!!!!"
truthful,"I  recently wanted to go to a buffet and decided to try Pacific Buffet it had recently opened in our area...i was surprised on how many different food options were at the buffet, and the food was good.  You should give it a try you won't be disappointed."
truthful,"I LOVE THIS STORE !!! If you love to decorate this is the store for you, they have such a variety, and so much to choose from you spend alot of time in there because you know your going to miss something!  Very good prices too...Have fun"
truthful,"My daughter and I love this place. Let me say that again: we LOVE this place.  It is the coolest thing since frozen yogurt.  I just found out there are different classes, and the latest one is cake decorating.  Never in my mind did I see myself use fondant...but here I am now.  I've make flowers, animals, and figurines.  And it's not just a one day course.  It's once a week for several weeks.  They start you out on basics and each week the techniques get more difficult.  The fondant days are the last days.  I can't wait until my next class!"
truthful,"I have been going to the Draft House for many years and have always enjoyed the food and the experience, but lately the food hasn't been that good and the new staff in the dining room has alot to be desired.  They were unattentive, gave us the wrong check, had to beg for a drink refill, and were pre-occupied with something else going on...not a good experience...very disappointed"
truthful,Get this!!!  Wow Karlo is amazing and best customer service you could ask for. He installed the antenna and set up all our tv's along with excellent detail explanations and conversation. We will be having my moms house done now next week also. The recoup savings from not having cable is only a few months. Already feels like we are saving money.
truthful,Best dental place ever they are so nice and when I told them my teeth were sensitive they paid attention and did a fantastic job. Our entire family goes there and I would highly recommend going there they take all types of insurance. I am the biggest chicken when it comes to going to the dentist and they made the experience wonderful.
truthful,Working with Shawna was great she was able to narrow down what we had no clue of what we wanted and we had to choose between three and absolutely loved and are enjoying our new bed. We never realized the sleep would be so much better. We would highly suggest going there.
truthful,Best bacon lettuce tomato sandwich ever services beyond great. We really enjoy sitting out on the patio in the open air. Lunch today there was great be sure if you're going to dinner there to make reservations.
truthful,Food was great service was excellent love coming hereand definitely will be coming back.
truthful,Went there Friday evening. Food and service was excellent and presented better than most other celebrity restaurants. The karaoke mc made the place even more fun. We are locals and will go back. Btw thank you for no parking fees for anyone
truthful,"Had such a great experience at Men's Wearhouse. When we walked in, we were greeted by the manager who was very attentive and paid attention to what we were looking for. He left us alone when we were browsing and helped when we were looking for sizes.  His name was Jeffrey Demoure and was great.  When he found out that my husband  was a police officer he very respectfully shook his hand and thanked him for his service. When we cheeked out, Jeffery gave us a discount for my husband's service. It was really sweet and we will ABSOLUTELY go back again"
truthful,Larry and Akilah are wonderful to deal with. They are professional and friendly. When moving it became apparent that we were going to need an additional unit. I called Larry when the moving guys were just about done loading the truck. I ran over there before the truck arrived. Larry had all the paperwork ready and I had lock and keys in hand as the truck arrived. Larry and Akilah made a stressful situation much better.
truthful,"I came here for lunch after reading previous reviews, and now I'm hooked! I come here at least twice a week now and love the salad and soup bar, as well as the red curry. Delicious!"
truthful,"I was on a business trip in Montreal and I made reservations for dinner 2 weeks prior. This was my first visit to APDC and the place was just buzzing with energy and the sweet smell of pork. Order the bison tongue as an appy and it was outstanding.  My friend had the seared foie gras and he kept rolling his eyes in delight. The bottle of wine was a beautiful Cote du  Rhone Quartz which paried very well with the meal.  For main, I had the maple pig's foot.  The presentation is shocking... the whole trotter in a cast iron pot with all the trimmings.  The taste was insane.  Skin was sweet and crunchy while the meat was juicy and savory.  The mash potato at the bottom soaked up all the essence from the dish. Very indulgent.  Brought 2 cans of duck in a can and flew them back to Vancouver.  Split one can the next night with 4 senior citizens and they were very impressed.  Gave the other one to a friend and she had hers 2 days later and it was still amazing.  Verdict:  These cans do travel so long as you keep them cold.  They are good for at least 3 days.  How do they stuff all the duck and foie gras with all the tirmmings in a small can?"
truthful,"I'm from Vancouver and have tasted all the ramen shops from Kintaro to Sanpachi.  Vancouver provides a wide array of ramen shops within a 1 mile radius within the downtown area.  While on a business trip in Toronto, I went in Kenzo for a late night bite and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the soup was steaming hot and had lots of death.  It was every bit as good as the Vancouver ramen shops.  Very impressed."
truthful,Excellent!!!! He came to my place and detailed my Yamaha R1 an my dirty super moto husky.  He did such a great job. The kind of work I thought only I would do with my own bikes.  I usually do them but sometimes life gets busy. It's nice to know someone takes the time to do every little detail I do. 100% happy and will use and recommend him over and over :-)  *A true ride so he 'gets it' ;-) thank you!
truthful,"Terrible service period, since we don't speak taiwanese people that showed up after us got seated before us. They got their food before us, the place is dirty. We waited at our table for over 10 minutes before ever being acknowledged (I'm pretty sure it would have been longer if we didn't go up to the cashier trying to order), the table we had to run and claim ourselves. The yelp location of the place is completely wrong so a couple of u turns had to happen. Waited forever for the food after waiting a lifetime to even put our order in. While waiting watching more people who arrived after us get their food.  The food is not worth going through all the crap.   And the check was wrong."
truthful,This place is the bees knees and beyond the cats pajamas! Marlon the bartender is amazing and needs a raise ASAP! And Angela?! Hubba hubba ;)))  Happy Hour specials is hard to beat here and the yogurts soju Is super yummy with good portions!
truthful,Amazing atmosphere! Love the cocktails and the truffle bacon mushrooms mac and cheese is amazing
truthful,Kailin was the best waitress! Very attentive and quick for a party of 6! Would highly recommend the kalbi beef with strawberry yogurt Soju.
truthful,"The food here is fresh and the coffee is delicately prepared. Thank god for Ilys Italian roast! Oliver is a very respectful host and super friendly. Every time I come here the service is friendly but a bit on the slow side since lunch is pretty busy.  Definitely try their eggplant and ANYTHING with pesto, it's delicious and the proportions are perfect for lunch! The seafood bisque is rich and creamy. If your feeling sweet try their monkey latte.  My only peeve is that this place is a little awkward to get to and it's tucked away on the side of a freeway and corporate offices."
truthful,"BEWARE!!  People at the store were helpful, but they charged my card the minute my order was placed online (on a weekend, when they couldn't be reached by phone), despite my explaining in the comments that I wanted to confirm the color before the order was completed.  They did call to discuss the color, and even sent photos to help me make a decision (especially since shipping to California was VERY expensive).  I got back to them - via e-mail - that I appreciated their help (which I did) but that I was not going to complete the order and, instead, continue to look for a color closer to what I was after.  I said that, if I decided to go with the alternate they suggested (different type of yarn and color), I would get back to them but, for now, I wanted to keep looking.  They responded by saying to let them know, and how nice the other yarn was.  Two weeks later, I get a message that they've shipped yarn to me!  I immediately contacted them, saying I had canceled the order - that I had told them I was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion, but their response was that it'd been two weeks so they automatically shipped.  I'm guessing they've sent the yarn I initially chose online....I have no idea!  They sent me no warning - no confirmation that they were going to ship....and that's when I discovered they'd charged me for the order the minute it was placed - NOT when it was shipped like every other company I've done business with online.  I'm EXTREMELY disappointed and will never do business with them again!  Beware if you give them any credit card info!  They'll use it whether you want them to or not, and the minute they have it....even when nothing has been settled or even shipped yet!!  To return it, and pay shipping twice would cost more than the yarn so I've been FORCED to make this purchase, even though they led me to believe I would not be."
truthful,"I have been eating here for years.  While the ambiance is not great, the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable.  I have probably eaten every item on the menu, lunch and dinner, and never been disappointed.   I am a bit of a Thai aficionado, originally from NY.  Bangkok Ocha is better than most.  I have had better Thai at significantly higher prices in Florida and California.  There are a couple of places in an Atlanta that are as good but overall this is a terrific ""once a week"" (at least) spot.  While I understand reviews are subjective; the details in some of these reviews, what was ordered and the comments, suggest input from Thai posers and dabblers rather than addicts.  I am the later."
truthful,"Well another vacation ruined by frontier.  What was a 2 hr delay turned into a 5 hr delay. Merry Christmas! !  Why don't u take better care of your planes so u don't disrupt the customers who actually fly your airline.  As for me, this is our last time!!!"
truthful,"Having been a luxury home real estate specialist in Arizona for over 17 years, I have very high expectations, not only of the vendors I use, but also those I recommend. Therefore, for my personal move, I engaged the moving and storage services of Get Your Move On. The office staff was very responsive in getting me on the schedule quickly, the follow up and customer service was impressive and the entire staff and crew were top notch professionals.  I have and will continue to recommend Get Your Move On to my clients without hesitation."
truthful,"Glorified Mandarin. Totally not worth the money. Take any Asian restaurant, pile  the food high, put some fresh herbs on top and you have Lee"
truthful,"Margarita was tasty. Food was decent, but seriously, who doesn't double stack their corn tortillas for tacos?!? A single corn tortilla has zero structural integrity, so I'm left forking my taco (Lame pun intended)."
truthful,"Smokeless Joe gets 5 stars for being one of the greatest concept restaurants I've been in...ever.  I completely understand and accept that my sense of Smokeless Joe's greatness is directly attached to my own love (LOVE) of a good pot of mussels.  Their African Peanut soup is also great, which makes me assume that the other stews and soups are too.  Additionally, I find the beer list here suits my taste better than any other I've found in Toronto so far, and the fact that the beeristas are willing (and required) to leave their bar fortress and go to the fridge at the back of the store makes me feel grossly indulgent asking for some of their bottled speciailties.  My one request for these guys is to find a way to add some pommes frites to the menu...but I'll be back weekly regardless."
truthful,The moules are great but the food and service don't quite add up to the prices...good place to take a date if they are turned on my the fatness of your wallet
truthful,"I just like small bars better...ok prices, crap beers, mixed crowd and ok music.  This is the type of place I associate with Cancun or Tijuana more than Toronto's scene..."
truthful,"I just moved to Toronto and had to ship my bike across from the states.  Sweet Pete's was very helpful in receiving, rebuilding, and giving my bike a nice tune-up.  I don't think I'll be living near Pete's, so I don't know how often i will go back, but i very much appreciate their helping me make my move a bit easier and will certainly recommend them to others."
truthful,"I had New Ho King delivered.  I did not/do not/do not plan to go to UT.  Those things said, and understanding there may be some ambiance-related pieces I am missing, the food was not so good although delivery service in both depth of menu (its like a road map of food....just keeps on unfolding) as well as open hours was impressive.  I would not totally rule out ordering here again...but it's going to have to be pretty late at night and probably a push between being conscious or passed out when the food arrives."
truthful,"As a hockey venue, this is as good as it gets (for a new arena...the Joe is still the best for obvious reasons).  On top of great seating, there are HUGE beers to be had, which reduces the impetus to leave one's seat and they also have a mean poutine, or heart attack fries as I like to call them.  Great entertainment value all around."
truthful,"So it's not the most delicious pizza in the world...but it's super fresh, super customizable, super fast, and super cheap.  Special right now gets a large pie, 10 wings, and 4 sodas for $22 (after tax)  which is insane.  I say well worth the price."
truthful,Got a new rack and panniers as well as some nice tires here and was happy with everything...will definietely try service dept out this year.
truthful,"I would give 3 starts, but they carry my favorite hard-to-find Danish beer (Tuborg) and that yields an extra star.  The moules (mussels) are definitely worth the 4 stars as well but the large party (read: non-cozy) atmosphere just doesn't quite fit the menu.  I think things here are a bit overpriced as well, but when you look around and see 10,000 sq ft of party space, it's easy to understand."
truthful,"I had major bike issues on the Don trail today and needed some TLC around 6pm.  I rode past Warren and they looked closed...so I called.  A very stoned sounding elderly lady answered saying ""Helloooooo?"".  So I asked if she was at Warren Cycle.  yes.  Are you open?  no.  What kind of hours ARE they open if not 6pm on a weekday?  Not going to waste my time going here again..."
truthful,"First time eating at this restaurant and it was an excellent experience. Coming from the Bay Area we are seasoned pakiindo food eaters. This food however is the best desi food we have ever tasted. The best part was seeing my pre teen kids enjoying the food. We ordered the wings, chicken tikka masala, chicken tandoori, chicken boti. I am coming again to Phoenix, just to eat here"
truthful,"The Audi experience starts with the purchase.  Audi North Scottsdale makes the buying and owning experience such a pleasure that you will probably always be an Audi owner.  The car speaks for itself as far as styling, technology,safety  and luxury.  The professionalism of every individual who works there inxluding Steve Bacca to Jaime Ossa to Jason Brown and Anthony Pacheco makes owning an Audi a complete pleasure and a great experience.  I am on my sixth Audi!"
truthful,The food is  quite good and true to home style cooking.  Very friendly good service
truthful,I was disappointed this time.  The service was great.  The food however was certainly not what one would expect in the least from a restaurant of this calibre.  My prime rib was tough and rubbery and so was the duck entree which my husband ordered.  I had a solid experience last time around so maybe it was just a bad night.
truthful,"Four stars for the food here, one star for the drinks.  The food is delish- favs include the kale & sweet potato wrap and the bbq chicken wrap.  My issue is with the juices... $11.25 for fresh pressed pesticides.  You cannot charge that much for a juice made with conventional (NON organic) produce and position yourself as a health conscious restaurant catering to that clientele.  People who can afford a $12 juice are smart enough to care where this guy sources his ingredients from.  Also worth noting that the meat is not organic either, so the whole concept is a little off for me."
truthful,"Three words: frozen hot chocolate.  It's epic & lives up to the hype!  Their desserts and food are geared toward tourists and nothing to write home about, but it's worth a trip for that hot chocolate- which, by the way, you can get from the takeout window without having to sit down."
truthful,"Todd English's latest is incredible!  Great atmosphere (cool bar, outdoor pub tables, red leather booths inside) and our server (Paul) was phenomenal.  Expansive bar and a huge selection of beers on tap, including some very enticing samplers.  No blue cheese olives for the martinis (bummer, since that's a signature drink at Olives).  Prices are high, as to be expected in City Center.  The seafood is the freshest I've had in all of Vegas- it's flown in every morning.  Their live bar comes by the piece- east and west coast oysters and delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail served on a gorgeous platter over ice and garnished with sea plants.  The duck buns were incredible- the meat was sweet and tender and the buns were like soft little pillows!  I've been dreaming about these ever since and I plan to come back for them!!  Lobster rolls were delicious- sweet rolls lightly buttered and grilled, then stuffed with lots of sauteed lobster meat.  The coleslaw they were served with was the best I've had.  The moules frites (mussels) came in a rich, delicious curry broth and even the fries were perfect.  We also had the pickles (three house-made varieties, thought they came with bottled mustard and not stone ground).  The smoked salmon quesadilla was incredible- with buttered yukon golds and fried capers.  They also do a fabulous bread pudding that is served with fresh whipped cream, salted caramel ice cream, and a delicious toffee sauce.  The bread pudding itself was the perfect texture and is one of my favorite desserts in all of Vegas.  This place rules, I cant wait to come back and try the carvery menu- chose your meat, sauces and bread.  Definitely recommended."
truthful,"BEST DONUTS EVER.  Seriously... they're amazing.  Huge selection of every variety imaginable- IF you come early.  Favs are the apple fritters (they let you chose from lighter or darker ones, depending on how done you like them), and their old fashioned buttermilk.  The donuts on the top two rows of the case are vegan,  but you'd never know it.  Their chocolate glazed cream filled (soymilk) and glazed raspberry jelly (gelatin-free) are crazy good.  I dream of these things.  Hole-in-the-wall smack dab in Chinatown.  The owner & her husband are as sweet as can be.  I only wish they were open 24 hours!"
truthful,"Love love LOVE Sambalatte!  Vegas has been lacking cafes like this one! I go here multiple times a week and everything has been perfect.  They have many different coffees brewed through various unique processes that make a French press look run of the mill.  Cappuccinos and lattes are full bodied and strong, and they have designs in the foam.  Great hot tea selection available in french press pots, and a delicious iced green yerba mate.  They have sandwiches (good caprese one, heated and served with a side of balsamic) and lots of desserts- including minis (napoleon, eclair, tiramisu cups, etc).  They also have gelato and sorbet, and my husband's all time fav- affogato (gelato with a shot of espresso poured over).  The atmosphere here is charming and warm, and they are open till 10pm wed-sat.  Service is excellent, they always walk upstairs to bring me my drink and are super friendly.  There is free wifi and an entire long table downstairs with multiple plugs for laptops.  Only negative is that I wish they stayed open later on weekends, especially for Vegas 10pm is early to close!"
truthful,"Marche Bacchus has a gorgeous view, but the food does not stand up (as is often the case).  The quality was average at best.  The lobster croissant that everyone raves about was terrible- a stale croissant unnecessarily toasted and filled with lobster meat that tasted fake.  It was shredded and almost had the texture of ""Krab"".  Very unappealing, and a very poor rendition of a lobster sandwich.  The signature bread pudding was also sub-par, burnt on top and dry throughout.  Definitely not worth the pre-ordering and 20 minute wait.   Service is disappointing, however the wine store is lovely and has a nice selection at reasonable prices.  The view is great and they have misters (major bonus in summer time), but next time I will be trying Garfield's next door in hopes of a better meal."
truthful,"Great pet boutique.  They carry all the hollistic brand foods, including the standard Wellness Formula and the grain free variety.  They have a great selection of treats, both bagged variety and behind their bakery counter.  They also have a nice selection of toys, harnesses, clothes, and bath products.  I love this store- prices are reasonable and staff are always friendly and knowledgable.  Highly recommended for anyone who feeds their dog/cat healthy food and treats!"
truthful,"I am updating my review of Luv-it... still the best frozen custard in Vegas (by a mile).  However, it is super lame that they use styrofoam cups in this day and age.  Polystyrene is not accepted by recycling (Waste Mgmt) in Las Vegas, it's a possible carcinogen, it's made with petroleum, it is clogging our landfills, ETC. (google it!).  With so many eateries going green and switching to eco-friendly packaging, I wish Luv-it would too.  This guy sells a ton of custard every day and I cant imagine how many of these cups he goes through.  You gotta get with the times!"
truthful,"MAD LOVE for the slider truck.  What a great concept, I am so glad this place is getting the attention it deserves.  Finally we have a gourmet mobile restaurant!  The weekly schedule is posted on their website www.slidinthru.com and on twitter.  My fav is the caprese (grilled eggplant, mozarella, toms, basil, balsamic).  They also have a pulled pork slider, a beef one with tzatziki and feta, a bbq one with carmelized jalapenos, and a classic with cheddar, bacon and special sauce.  Supposedly they are going to start doing a chicken one too- fantastic news for me and my husband since we dont eat red meat!  Their buns are great and everything has a really nice smokey flavor from the grill.  They have regular fries, and really good sweet potato fries (tossed in cinnamon and sugar).  Only thing I wish they had is unsweetened iced tea, and I am looking forward to more chicken and fish specials.  Prices are reasonable, ingredients are high quality, and these guys (especially Ric) are total chillers.  There is always a line and your sliders are made to order, so be prepared to wait a couple minutes.   If you haven't been here, be sure to check it out.  I cannot give this place enough praise, mad props for a guy in his 20's acting on a really great idea- Vegas SO needed this!"
truthful,"Mad Hatter cupcakes are not good.  I have tried every cupcake bakery in Vegas and these rate at the bottom.  They use oil and poor quality ingredients and their cupcakes look very unrefined (almost unappetizing).  This would be a cute place for a cheesy kid's birthday party because you can customize your own cupcake (cake, filling, frosting, and topping).  Unfortunately their cakes are tasteless and the frosting is overly sweet.  These dont hold a candle to The Cupcakery, Sprinkles, or any other decent joint."
truthful,"Olive's is a fantastic restaurant, exactly what you'd expect from Todd English.  The flavors are somewhat mediteranean and they've got a great menu.  Their cocktails are fabulous, I love their white peach belini and my husband is crazy about their dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  The bread basked comes with fresh baked onion foccacia and two kinds of olive tapenade.  They have some really good apps, including a great ahi tartare and some really nice flatbreads (one with proscuitto and figs, another with mushrooms, and a great classic tomato-basil-mozarella).  Favs on the dinner menu include the scallops (perfectly seared, served with risotto), the butternut squash tortellini, and the chestnut ravioli (served on a bed of creamed spinach-heavenly!).  Do not skip dessert here- they have a souflee that is crazy good.  Flavors change but the strawberry is incredible, so is the vanilla.  My husband and I order two, that's how delicious they are.  Service here is always great, very attentive.  I recommend sitting on the patio, it's much more private and has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and water show.  Definitely make reservations or you could be waiting 2 hours for a table."
truthful,"Great coffee shop in the Henderson part of town.  They have really good iced tea, avaiable in 3 flavors- including unsweetened peach black tea and passion berry (amazing!).  Their coffee is fair trade organic and varies daily.  They have a small selection of pastries and some breakfast and lunch options (vegan friendly).  They have a good breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, beans, cheese, fresh avocado and lots of spinach.  There are comfy seats and a bookcase full of books, however they are only open till 8pm.  Awesome eclectic staff, super friendly and knowledgeable about their coffees.  I wish they had a larger/better pastry selection and were open later.  We need a place in Vegas that is comparable to the living room in SD, and this is the closest I have found so far!  I so wish they'd open one in the Summerlin-ish area!!"
truthful,"Original Pancake is one of the best breakfast places ever.  They are a chain, and their locations in Rancho Santa Fe (SD), Palm Desert, Chicago, etc are all way more charming than this one.  That said, breakfast here is always consistently delicious and the service is great.  Their omelettes are fluffy and baked with the ingredients inside, almost like a souflee.  They do a great dutch baby, german apple pancake, and a dutch garden (dutch baby topped with veggies and cheese).  Their pancakes are my favorite- thin and flavorful, you can smell the buttermilk.  They come in every flavor, including seasonal pumpkin (amazing!) and fresh strawberry with whipped cream (during summer months, with fresh not canned whipped cream).  They also have classics like eggs benedict, corned beef hash, and amazing swedish pancakes (thin like crepes).  They also have a location in GVR that is newly expanded, for people on the Henderson side of town."
truthful,"Hugo's is a Vegas landmark and an old school experience not to be missed.  Let me be perfectly clear that it is in the Four Queens Hotel, a dive hotel on the old strip with the parking lot to match.  That said, when you step down the stairs into Hugo's Cellar you are in an entirely different environment.  Ladie's are greeted with a rose and the setting is very romantic (dark wood walls, candlelight).  Service is excellent and they have some great sommeliers.  They have a very good wine list and serve complementary bottled water, as well as a nice bread basket with cheese-toasted lavash and rose-shaped butter.  Their salads are the highlite, included with your meal and freshly prepared on a cart at your table.  Toppings like hearts of palm and bay shrimp and delicious dressings- try the orange walnut vinaigrette.  You are served an intermezzo sorbet to cleanse the palatte (raspberry on a mini cone).  Dinner is very traditional- chicken, fish, and steaks served with a potato and vegetable.  Not especially gourmet or cutting edge, but very old school classic and part of the experience.  They offer traditional desserts such as bananas foster prepared tableside, and they bring a complementary dessert of chocolate covered strawberries, dried figs, and apricots served with whipped cream.  This restaurant is great and remeniscent of old Vegas, definitely a must try."
truthful,"This place is super clean (major bonus points!) and they have great vegetarian pho.  I am mostly restaurant vegetarian and it's hard to find pho that is not either a beef or chicken broth.  Their's (I think called tofu/vegetable) is very flavorful, salty, and comes with a platter of very fresh veggies to arrange in your soup as you like.  My husband and I each get a large bowl- it is huge and takes forever to eat!  Their fresh spring rolls (the cold ones) are good, but not the best i've had.  The sweet sauce that comes with them is great.  Major bonus points for a place that offers a veg pho on par with the traditional beef one!"
truthful,"Glazier's is pretty middle of the road for me. Let me start off by saying that the store has a very strong, strange odor that has lingered since they first opened (my husband says its tolerable, I find it hard to bear). The layout is nice and the store looks impressive compared to most regular grocery stores (Smiths, Vons, etc). They have a large produce selection at very affordable prices. Lots of exotic fruit, vegetables, and peppers that cannot be found at conventional grocers. However, their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking (and way too expensive when compared to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or even Vons). They have a great selection of ready made food, but few healthy options. Pizza, ice cream, sushi, pasta salads, pasta entrees, vegetable and starch sides, etc. Some of what I've tried has been good, including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto, green beans almondine, mixed vegetable rice, broccoli with peppers, etc. They also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread (La Brea Bakery olive bread, jalapeno cheddar, pain rustic, organic whole grain, etc). They have a huge bakery with donuts, pastries, pies and cakes at shockingly low prices, but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to Whole Foods, but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable. They do have an organic/natural food section but they do not have organic eggs, meat, etc.  I could not do my regular grocery shopping here, but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget. It is far better than a Walmart or Smart and Final and I like the fact that it's family owned. Their produce selection is worth a trip alone. I also find myself coming here when I get home late and don't want to cook- their ready made and pre-packaged food is available 'till they close at midnight. I wish they'd offer reusable bags, a discount card, and a juice bar among their ready made food stations. I also wish they'd refresh their magazines- I feel like I am in the twilight zone when I stand in line and see covers from weeks ago."
truthful,"This place is fab... they have every single toy imaginable- from the typical pet store brands to more boutique style game/brain teaser toys (my dogs are currently obsessed w/ hide-a-squirrel!).  They also have food, treats, leashes, harnesses and more- all discounted.  Love this place."
truthful,"This is one of the best places for boba tea in the city.  They have an extensive menu featuring the usual flavored black and green teas, slushes, snow ices, and smoothies.  Their prices are more reasonable than most tea houses in Chinatown, the service is friendly, and the place is clean as can be.  There are always people getting take-out drinks here and there are a couple tables inside and out front.  Favs include the strawberry milk tea and passion fruit black tea, both with boba.  My husband loves their fruit slushes."
truthful,"Pet Pros is a nightmare, I cannot emphasize this enough.  Their dogs come from puppy mills, they were taken from their mothers far too soon and many dogs in the store have kennel cough and other illnesses due to improper care.  The staff, as expected, tell you the dogs came from reputable breeders and have papers, which means nothing and is standard in this industry.  This is where people go to purchase ""designer dogs"" for astronomic prices, without doing the research or investigating this industry.  A simple search on google will tell you all you need to know about petstores, puppy mills, and the store itself.  Go to petfinder.com and search for a rescue dog that fits your needs, or check out local animal shelters.  If you are looking for a specific hypoallergenic dog, check out breed-specific rescue organizations (ie. poodle rescue).   Dont breed or buy while shelter pets die."
truthful,"Tommy Bahamas is great.  I have eaten at their restaurants in Maui, Palm Desert, and here in Vegas- they are all consistently fabulous.  Service is always attentive and they have a great happy hour in the bar (there are also comfy booths if you dont want to sit at the actual bar).  Happy hour is I think from 4-7pm weekdays- discounted apps and drinks, and some really good fish tacos.  Their bread is in the shape of a crown, served hot with a sweet cinammon butter.  Great apps- favs include the coconut shrimp, cayman lollipops (chicken drumettes with mango bbq sauce), goat cheese with mango salsa and flatbread, and the ahi poke.  At lunch they have really nice salads and some great sandwiches, including a beer-battered crispy fish sandwich with tarter sauce and honey roasted onions.  For dinner, they have great seafood and a really great stuffed chicken (herb cheese and roasted red pepper cream).  Dessert here is a must, the pina colada cake is good but the butterscotch pudding is incredible.  Most desserts are available in small sizes, though they dont display this on the menu so you'll have to ask.  I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner on the patio on warm summer nights."
truthful,"Tea Station is my favorite place for boba tea in Chinatown.  Their prices are definitely higher than most of the competition, but they do offer a discount on all to-go drinks.  And lets be real, some of the other tea houses in the area are just plain creepy.  The menu is extensive (over 10 pages of tea) and the atmosphere is nice.  This place is very clean- major bonus points, especially if you've frequented some of their local competition.  Tea Station is always packed, especially at night since they are open late.  My favs are their passion fruit green tea with boba, or the iced mixed fruit tea (although this one is super sweet).  My husband likes their fruit slushes.  This is a great place to get work done during the day (free wifi) or meet friends at night.  It is very popular for takeout drinks, in fact I always see 5-0 popping in here for their late night boba fix.  Service is reasonably friendly but definitely on the slow side, especially during busy times.  I would not recommend the food (their squid balls were inedible and smelled like a mixture of hot garbage and the ocean, though perhaps they are an acquired taste!).  I recommend this place based on their atmosphere, tea, and the fact that they are open late.  This is definitely more of a traditional tea house than your average take-out boba shop."
truthful,"Layers is the best bakery in Vegas, without question.  This place is the closest thing Vegas has to a high quality bakery on par with SF or LA.  They use high quality ingredients and everything is always fresh, never sitting out more than that same day (like other lame bakeries in the area!).  Favs include their butter bars, cupcakes (flavors change daily), and sticky buns (get there early, these go super fast).  They also do beautiful celebration cakes to order (and have some avaiable in store every day).  I only wish they had more French pastries (almond croissants, napoleans, eclairs, brioche, etc).  That would bump them up to 5 star status!"
truthful,"Dupar's is all about the pancakes- go here for them, they're incredible.  Fluffy, drizzled with butter, & served up 24/7!  Solid breakfast here... bruleed oatmeal w/ fresh fruit, & eggs florentine among my favs.  They also have a great tuna melt, split pea soup, carved turkey sandwiches, pies, etc.  This is my go-to spot after a late night downtown, and for breakfast when I'm willing to make the trek down to Freemont.  Everyone I've taken here loves this place- they have an expansive menu and those pancakes are the absolute bomb!!  Best in Vegas, maybe even the best ever..."
truthful,"Vivido Gelato is good, but not authentic Italian gelato.  Large selection of flavors, but they're lacking some traditional staples (straciatella, fior de latte, etc) and need more fruit options.  Prices are high, especially given the small servings (two small gelatos for $8).  Also, they limit you to two flavor samples per person, which they announce when you walk in.  This just seems really cheap of them and totally rubbed me the wrong way.  There is something in their gelato that makes it very stretchy, almost gummy.  The mint was pretty good (but colored with green dye), blood orange was okay but not very flavorful.  I will probably go back if I crave gelato again, but only because there is nowhere else in the area."
truthful,"This is the best dog store in Vegas.  The selection cannot be beat- they carry all the hollistic dry and wet foods, as well as treats.  Great selection of Wellness Formula, which is what I feed my dogs.  They also have a huge variety of toys, chews, clothes, beds, leashes, harnesses, bath products, etc.  They will special order anything you want that is not in-store.  Unfortunately I live clear across town from this store, or I would shop here far more often.  As far as pet stores in Vegas, this is as good as it gets."
truthful,"Hedary's is legit Lebanese food.  Really yummy mango juice (more like a nectar and not overly sweet).  Solid hummus, good tabouli and Greek salads, and an incredible lentil soup.  Falafel are flavorful and not overly fried, although the sandwich was a bit on the dry side (needed more veggies/sauce to balance out the grittiness of the falafel balls).  Pita bread alone is worth the visit here- sweet, puffy, and served hot out of the oven.  I definitely want to come back for their lunch specials, and to try the shrimp scampi (ordered by the table next to us- smelled and looked amazing!).  Hummus, pita & that lentil soup are better here than anywhere else in the valley."
truthful,"This is THE premier alpaca store in the valley, if you're into this sort of thing.  I happen to love various furs- from Mongolian Lamb, to sheepskin, to alpaca- and this store is a fur heaven!!  I take trips out here with friends when we want to update or add to our collections.  I love that no animals are killed for this fur, and the quality is exceptional.  They have fab pillows, rugs, and various accents for the home- as well as some pretty cute sweaters.  I've also gotten some handmade moccasins and a horseshoe hook here, designed by a local artist in Boulder City.  Prices are on the high side (which is typical for alpaca), but the men that work here (owners, I'm guessing) have been accommodating at lowering the price (especially when you buy several items).  If you're looking for Alpaca, this is the place to go!"
truthful,"I'm a fan of Rachel's.  Like another yelper said- Vegas needs way more places like this!  It's a gourmet little breakfast and lunch spot, you order at the counter and there are some cute tables in and outside.  They have breakfast burritos, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, burgers (beef, chicken), soups, pastas, and huge salads (spinach, curry chicken, cobb).  There is a nice selection of veg options and everything is fresh and high quality.  Pastries could be much improved on and I wish they served breakfast past 11 on weekends.  Mad props for having fresh brewed tropical unsweetened iced tea."
truthful,"Earl of sandwich is a great concept and the menu is super enticing.  Prices are fair, quality is average.  The turkey is in the form of cold cuts (not roasted like Capriotti's) and mirrored the quality of a Quiznos or- worse yet- Subway.  The bread here is baked fresh to order and is fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside- yum.  The All American sandwich was okay, but again the quality of the turkey was off putting.  It had cranberry sauce, buttermilk ranch, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar.  The fellow reviewer who said this sandwich trumps the Bobbie must have had a few too many, I mean really.  The tuna melt, however, was great- very simple with just tuna salad and melted cheese, but delicious.  If you like tuna melts then this is the place for you (that might have been a 5-star sandwich!).  Potato salad was average and they have a selection of other salads and kettle chips.  There is also an assortment of baked goods, unfortunately the chocolate cupcake we tried was yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting (lame!).  The earl gray lemonade was refreshing and delicious, and I loved that it was something different.  Major props for having good vegetarian options (veggie sandwich with feta and peppers and a caprese).  I'd probably come back for the tuna melt and an earl gray lemonade, but I am shocked that this place has better ratings than the much superior Tom Colicchio brainchild Witchcraft (which uses vastly superior ingredients and has more exciting offerings).  Mad props that it's open 24 hours."
truthful,"Sababa has moved up to five star status- strictly based on their falafel.  Let me be perfectly clear, I have never had anything else here.  However, this is the best falafel in Vegas- and I have tried many.  The falafel and hummus comes in a pita pocket filled with tahini, tomatoes, pickles, cabbage, cucumbers, and lettuce.  They have an incredible green parsley hot sauce (crazy hot!) and their falafel is moist all the way through (not dry in the center like many others).  The falafels are fried to order and the sandwich is made in front of you.  Still wish they had fresh brewed iced tea, but I usually get takeout anyway.  This place is Israeli owned and about as authentic as it gets."
truthful,"I love Red Velvet Cafe, for their baked goods alone.  I have never eaten the food here, but have visited many times for tea and cake and often pick up their baked goods to bring home.  The owner's wife does all the baking herself, and it is clear that great care has gone into developing her recipes.  My favorite is the red velvet cake, which looks like a large cupcake and is topped with a deliciously sweet frosting and a whole strawberry.   They also do a delicious chocolate peanut butter cake, also in the shape of a large cupcake with a moist chocolate cake and rich peanut butter frosting.  The best part about these cakes is that they are under 200 calories, vegan, and free of any saturated or trans fats.  She does not use artificial sweeteners or make things that are low fat but still unhealthy- these cakes are all natural, preservative free, and taste delicious.  I highly recommend this place for their baked goods alone, and I look forward to trying their food.  The menu features sandwiches, pastas, salads, and an assortment of vegan meats and cheeses that are all made on site."
truthful,"Went back to Fresh 52 today with the desperate hope that they'd expanded and added a few more vendors.  Unfortunately you can literally walk through the entire place in under 5 mins, so it's hardly worth the drive across town.  However, there are a couple places that will keep me coming back (at least on occasion).  The bread from Bon Breads is solid and they have lots of varieties (white chocolate batard, multigrain, pretzel rolls, ciabatta, etc).  Also the salsa and chutneys from Miguel's rock!  The salsas all have a great kick, and they have a mango one too.  They have jalapeno jellies and an amazing apricot jalapeno chutney that is super flavorful.  A couple places have come in since summer and a couple have gone out- there is still a decent sized produce stand but its strange that there was only the one vendor.  There is a face painting station, a dog store, and a booth that sells Scentsy.  There is also an organic, loose leaf tea stand and another with baked goods (although there were very few options).  There is a crepe stand too, but they were mostly dessert flavors rather than breakfast options.  I wish this place was 10 times the size it is, but it's still worth checking out and most of the vendors were solid."
truthful,"This review is for the spa only.  It's a fab property that I've enjoyed coming to for years... unfortunately this place is pretty dead lately and the staff are not friendly.  My masseuses have all been good but nail techs not so much.  If they are struggling for clients they need to up the ante and make it a great experience worth the drive.  Also, the pool was closed due to it being a weekday (so we couldn't use the full spa amenities, which is why we go)."
truthful,"Benjrong is a great neighborhood Thai place... my husband and I have been getting take-out from here on a weekly basis since they opened and have never been disappointed.  The service is excellent and the restaurant could not be cleaner or more pristine- the entire kitchen is on display (major bonus!).  Favs include their vegetable egg rolls (love that sweet, clear chili sauce), tom yum soup, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, and the currys.  Their hot sauce is great, so are the lunch specials.  The food does not compare to L.O.S. or Komol in terms of the flavor or complexity, but everything I've had has always been fresh and delicious.  I definitely recommend this spot- it is way above average for a local Thai place and is not filthy, dingy, poor quality, or lacking flavor- like so many other local places...!"
truthful,"Five stars for the falafel at Amena!  Similar in style to the falafel in pita at Sababa (hummus, cabbage, pickles, tomatoes, etc), but even better.  Their pita is fluffy & delicious, like soft little pillows.  Falafel are bright green, flavorful, and the perfect size.  You order at the counter and when it's ready, you come up and chose what veggies you want inside.  They also have a good homemade hot sauce on the tables, and a great selection of bakery items including a really great baklava.  Best falafel in pita I've had in Vegas.  I wish I'd tried this place sooner... the creepy Trader Joe's strip mall/dive-y location was throwing me off.  I should have trusted Misty's review because I've been missing out!  And like she said- they sell their pita bread!!"
truthful,"Familia is in a strip mall on Durango and delivers to the surrounding area super fast.  Good service & they always get your order right.  Love their garlic knots, greek salad, and pizzas (cheese w/ ricotta & basil is our standby).  They also have calzones and stromboli.  Good cannolis- thick cream with cinnamon and chocolate chips, filled to order in their homemade shells.  Spumoni ice cream for sale by the tub.  Way better than Marcos or some of the other chains in the vicinity!"
truthful,"Love this sushi spot, I've been coming here for the past few years.  They're in Town Square across the street from H&M, next to Yogurtland.  Atmosphere is warm and trendy and is why I often prefer Kabuki to other places in the area.  Comfy private booths, tables, sushi bar, and an outdoor patio.  Usually crowded from happy hour (great specials) to closing, but I've never had to wait more than 10-15 mins.  Extensive cocktail menu, decent wine selection and several flavored non-alcoholic drinks including sweet mango iced tea and mint lemonade.  Edamame comes with all sushi orders.  Good miso soup and house salad with ginger dressing, decent seaweed salad but not my fav.  Lots of apps, including fried eggplant and calamari.  Large selection of specialty sushi rolls, fav is the Lotus on Fire roll (spicy tuna, jalapeno and lotus root on california rolls).  Extensive menu with lots of pictures, and lots of non-sushi items including teriyaki, noodle dishes, soups, seafood, etc.  Fresh fish, great service & atmosphere!"
truthful,"Settebello is definitely the best Italian pizza i've had outside of Italy.  Their crust is bubbly, chewy and delicious.  They have some nice salads and a yummy focaccia (this is really just their pizza crust baked with some oregano and sea salt, but delicious none the less).  Great sangria, coctails, and espresso.  Unfortunately, their iced and hot teas are lipton (lame!!).  The margherita pizza is delicious, as is the four cheese (with gorgonzola and ricotta, yum!).  Their cannolis are good, traditional with dried fruit and chocolate chips but the shells and cream were both a little thick.  Their gelato is also good, but very airy and not dense like traditional gelato (great flavors though, including a seasonal apricot).  Comfortable atmosphere with tables and booths (props) and well worth the drive across town.  Five stars based on their pizza alone- delicious!"
truthful,"5 stars for the chai latte at Tipsy- best chai I've found in Vegas.  Spicy and not overly sweet, and major bonus points for being able to order it with almond or soy milk.  The chocolates here are also great- the s'mores bar is graham cracker-y, peanut buttery amazingness.  Definitely a spot worth checking out."
truthful,"Lucilles is really great BBQ, definitely the best in Vegas by far. They're located in The District in GVR and the atmosphere is really great, very southern. Expect an insane wait here on weekends, but it's well worth it. They have some of the best sweet tea I've had, served in a huge maison jar. The bread basket is stuffed with buttermilk biscuits and apple butter, and they have some really good apps like pulled chicken sliders on sweet rolls, fried green tomatoes with red pepper cream, and fried pickles (spears, not chips served with remoulade). They have delicious salads (one with sauteed shrimp, one with smoked salmon and a peach vinaigrette, one with BBQ chicken and onion strings). They have the usual meat platters with brisket, tri tip, ribs, chicken, etc. They have a good blackened catfish and some incredible sandwiches- my favorite is the BBQ chicken sandwich with melted cheddar, onion straws, and lots of field greens on a french roll (they also have yummy potato buns). Sides are awesome- good mac n cheese, peanut slaw, sweet potato fries, cheese grits, etc.  Mad props for being one of the few BBQ joints that also caters to vegetarians- veggie burger, salad, or a really good marinated portobello sandwich with melted cheese and garlic mayo. Desserts include fruit cobbler, pecan pie, peach bread pudding, banana pudding, and red velvet cake !! There is a separate take out area near the entrance that absolutely kills it. Service is great and prices are reasonable, especially given the huge portions and quality. This is the only place my husband and I go when we crave BBQ, and we often take out of town guests here for the great atmosphere and food."
truthful,"I bought my car here late last year and have had good experiences with both their sales and service staff.  They are knowledgeable about all the models (including mine, which was new for 2010) and they do not leave harassing messages or turn into stalkers if you need some time to think before making your lease/ purchase.  They always loan me a Lexus rental during servicing, even if I did not reserve one in advance.  The waiting room here is about as nice as one could be- flat screen, comfy couches, drinks, bagels/cookies (my husband creeps on their cookies like they're going out of style).  Thorough car wash (inside and out) with every service.  When an update was needed for my car's computer system, they came to my house and installed it.  Unfortunately they are the only Lexus dealer in the entire Valley, so they aren't exactly wheelin & dealin here.  I hear they are opening another location in the Henderson area, which i'm sure will be a huge plus for people on the other side of town."
truthful,"The Molto Vegas Farmer's Market is one of my favorite things to do in this city.  This is an indoor famer's market, located on Dean Martin in a warehouse.  It runs on Thursdays from 11am-1pm, with a previewing for chefs at 10am.  I found out about this place by eating at one of Batali's restaurants- it's all through word of mouth, they dont advertise.  There is lots of fresh produce including some nice heirloom tomatoes, herbs, lettuce, interesting citrus, etc. though it is not all organic.  Their prices are high, as to be expected.  They do not carry dairy for sale to the public, aside from cheeses sometimes (goat, gouda, and a heavenly buratta that sells out immediately).  You have to be a member of their profit sharing group to purchase the eggs.  There are a couple other vendors that sell coffee, dates, and some hydroponicly grown herbs.  This market is very small and even mediocre compared to what you would find in California or Seattle, but it is much better than the other farmer's markets here in Vegas.  Be sure to bring your reusable bag!"
truthful,"The ONLY company in town to use for anything water heater related.  Had my water heater replaced for $650 (other companies quoted between $800-$1k).  Charlie and Shane were awesome- straightforward, on time & super honest.  Highly recommend."
truthful,"Love the cheap flights, plane was clean and attendants was really nice.  Everyone complains about additional charges but if you read the fine prints and understand their policy, then you'll have absolutely no problem."
truthful,"Went there for my Husbands birthday on 12/16 and the food was not as good as the first time we went in January 2014.  The soup was cold, the shitake mushroon side taste like soy sauced mushrooms and the American cap was flavorful but was tough. 5 star is for the American Kobe, mac and cheese and the French Press coffee (Yumo).  We really like the service and hope the next time we go to Vegas, the food will be as good as the first time."
truthful,We stopped by for Pho since we were soo done with the Vegas mass grazing from last night.  The Pho here is decent as far as Vegas goes and the broth doesn't taste artificially sweet like some places when they load the MSG in there. Their bean sprouts are super clean and white which is a good indication they do it right. We may come back again if we have a Pho craving while in Vegas. Oh don't order the Che Ba Mau dessert it is a rip off!
truthful,The Roast Pork was crispy and is better than Sam Woo. The BBQ pork noodle was okay because the BBQ pork wasn't great. The food is definitely made for Asian taste and thus authentic.  If you like sweet and sour then this ain't the place(try Panda Express). Portions are huge so be ready to share:-)
truthful,I am from LA where there are many Sam Woos and this one's got to be the worst. You would think being the only one in Vegas it would do a better job at living up to the name like its LA restaurants instead they take a monopoly attitude. Food is mediocre and portions half of the same order in LA places. We tried the Roast Duck and you can tell it wasn't done thoroughly trhough and the meat didn't marinate through long enough. We also tried the clam and Ginger scallions. Clams were not fresh and the sauce had too much corn starch that it was thick and startchy:( Also don't ask for forks or spoons as they still had clumps of someone elses dinner still stuck on them!!!stay with the disposable bamboo chopsticks!!
truthful,"AVOID. The worst customer service I have experienced in Las Vegas. Extremely hard to cancel account. I was told my account was closed and current then was still billed after I moved when they claimed I still have bottles that were not dropped off. Long wait times for customer support. If there are other options, use them! Trust me, you are better off getting a faucet water filter."
truthful,Great customer service from Linda. First Affogato and it was great! We tried the strawberry and cheesecake gelato. It's all delizioso!!
truthful,"The reasons I choose this place over Chipotle: Wheat Tortilla, Brown Rice option, pesto cilantro sauce, no charge for guacamole on items. I go here probably 2 times a week lately because it is a good option for a healthy meal. I usually get the salad with brown rice, black beans, chicken, pesto sauce and salsa. I also like the option for a wheat tortilla. Guacamole is fresh and has always been good. Great food, great healthy options, good service."
truthful,Some of the most authentic BBQ I've had in Vegas to date. Brisket was by far the best item on the menu. They know what they are doing. BBQ is a tough sell in Las Vegas and I hope they stay put for a long time. Well done!
truthful,I was a customer for 6 years. Always paid my bill on time. I go to cancel my account (a month before I move) and I was told to bring all bottles and dispenser in before March 1st. I returned all bottles and dispenser on Feb. 23rd. I was given a receipt that said my account was closed and current. Today I get a bill for $30 and they say I have 5 bottles to return still!? Are you kidding me? You looked at my account on Feb. 23 and cleared it! Took 30mins on hold to get customer service and was just told that she sent an email and a response would take 3 days. If THEY determine I somehow have these mystery bottles of water that I never received I will not be refunded. AVOID THIS SERVICE! TRUST ME. Everything about closing the account was (and still is) a nightmare. Do yourself a favor and do business with someone else! Some of the WORST customer service I have seen in Las Vegas to date. Shame of businesses that know they are below standards and continue to operate without making changes to provide better service. I hope all the negative reviews catch up to you and you see a decline in your profits because I am guessing that is the only way you will fix the issues.
truthful,"Let me preface this review by stating some facts. I lived here for 6 years. We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for.   2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.  Once you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record)   Sounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in ""5 star"" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in ""5 star"" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4/15/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been ""processed"" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free. Good Riddance, Vintage at the Lakes. And no, you can't buy a 5 star review from me."
truthful,"Cool little breakfast spot. Staff was really great. Nice atmosphere and country decor. We had the red velvet pancakes and the Monte Cristo. They were INSANELY good. If you aren't watching the calories go and try these. They also have a good selection of items for you if you are eating very healthy too, as I look forward to heading back there and trying the lighter options as well. A+"
truthful,I have had the pleasure of having Budesa Photography shoot many things for me. Always professional and streamlined efficient. I would recommend to anyone without batting an eye!
truthful,"LOVE this place, and here's why...... - GREAT, friendly and fast service. There are always 3-4 people coming by your table and refilling water/soda/beer/chips/salsa/bean dip! They are on top of it! - Fresh tasting food. A lot of Mexican food around town (and elsewhere for that matter) taste like it's been sitting around for hours waiting to be served. This almost always seems fresh. - Fair prices! The prices for items and combos are great! Great happy hour too.  I recommend the rancho style tacos and (of course) the fajitas!  I hope people support this place and keep it in town. This is a hard location for businesses to prosper it seems. SUPPORT GOOD BUSINESSES!"
truthful,"We just purchased a couch, computer table and chair here. Rashard helped us and was absolutely great! He was extremely helpful and had great customer service."
truthful,"My girlfriend and I have ordered from Ninja Fit Meals about 5 times now. It is great! All of the meals we have had so far are really good, some we just like over others. They have taken my customization and substitutions to the meals and nailed it every time! They care about pleasing the customer and helping you stay on track with specific needs. The delivery driver always calls and/or texts to tell you he is on the way, which is nice. If you aren't home you can leave a cooler our with ice blocks and they will put the meals in there. We love the carb-less chow mein, turkey burger, turkey meatballs with spaghetti squash. All in all for meal prep and customer service, they are doing a great job! Thank you. - Cody"
truthful,"HORRIBLE!  We got a late night dinner there and everything was horrible. First, it looked like it was closed. I am sure that the employees do this so people just drive away (I wish we did). Our order was wrong. Cold and super greasy fries.   and the chicken sandwich was RAW! If you think it's a pain to cook chicken late at night because it takes awhile SAY YOU ARE ALL OUT! But never rush it.  This place needs to either be under new management or torn down. Start over with a place that gives a damn."
truthful,"I have been only volunteering at Toys 4 Smiles for a few weeks now but I can definitely say this is a great group of individuals that are donating a lot of time and energy to do something simple yet profound, make children happy. In a society full of high-speed entertainment (internet, cell phones and video games) fueled by a ""I want it yesterday"" mentality, it is refreshing to see something like Toys 4 Smiles. These toys are very simple, yet very high quality. It is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was HANDMADE for them but also requires them to use their imaginations. The way I think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys don't have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem ""worth it."" Well, I am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger CARES. They are worthy of it and deserve it. It's a simple thing but if that message reaches some children that message could possibly affect a life.   I encourage anyone looking to donate some time (doesn't matter how much) to give them a call and head on in and help make some toys!"
truthful,"The hidden gem in Summerlin!   This is a little restaurant (separated from the gaming side) hidden by the Lake in Summerlin. We didn't expect much from this place but after reading the great reviews and it being so close to our home we had to try it.  IT WAS GREAT. Here's why...... - Friendly staff! Always smiling and it's a relief to see people working in F&B in Las Vegas that look like they are genuinely happy. - The food. I'm sorry to say but I didn't expect great food. I was mistaken. Everything we tried was pretty dang good. The breakfast burrito was great. The club sandwich was huge and great tasting. The quesadilla was maybe my favorite I've ever had, with the peppers inside, the crema on top and it wasn't greasy at all. Corn beef hash was also good. The eggs and bacon may be the downfall for them. They seem like they are instant and the bacon was majorly overcooked. Looking forward to trying the chicken pot pie and some other things there! - Price. It is VERY fair.  This place feels like a little local spot back home for us. So for that and the other reasons I listed, we will be coming back...... a lot. =)"
truthful,"I am somewhat new to comics. I read some as a kid but really just started getting into them more as an adult.   I have been in some comic book shops where it feels like being a newbie is a bad thing and they don't really want you there. THIS ISN'T THAT TYPE OF PLACE!  The staff is great! They answer all my questions without some weird superiority judgment. (they also remembered me by name after only a few visits) They set up a subscription box for me to keep track of the comics I want. They matched some prices I found online for some back issues I needed. They call around to other stores to track down the issues you may need. They have a decent rewards card that when you fill it up you get a free book. The toys there are pretty fairly priced as well.  Overall, great place!"
truthful,"I recently planned my birthday party here complete with trying the ""MONSTER PIZZA CHALLENGE"" I have to say from the time I called to ask about having my party there to the time we left that night the staff there was awesome! It's so rare to find genuinely friendly staff in Las Vegas. They had our reservation perfect and gave my party it's own side of the restaurant. There was games for the kids. The pizza was very good. Roberto is a great manager (owner?) and he accommodated us with every need we had, which included staying open a little late. Do yourself a favor and go and support a Las Vegas business that deserves your money, time and appetite.   ps - all you other Las Vegas business owners, Go to Graziano's Pizza and take note of how to treat customers right."
truthful,Great food. Great service. Definitely go try this place. I haven't tried the egg&tofu but have had everything else and it's great. Fries are awesome!!!
truthful,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  Basically, this is chipotle/subway of pizza. Great and fair prices. Quality ingredients. Daily specials. Friendly staff. Beer.  Great concept. This place really does things right! The white pizza was great, as well as the classic margherita pizza.  The downside I think for this place is the..... NAME. It's hard to associate ""custom built"" with pizza, especially if you are driving down the street and can't see the ""pizza"" part written very small. To me, this seems like a great name for a cabinet maker or something.  We love this place and hope it survives the rough Las Vegas restaurant market but it doesn't ever seem that busy and I think the name is what's hurting it.    What helps this place? Word of mouth and Yelp reviews!"
truthful,We came here on a Friday around 5:00. I was a little nervous because of the other reviews but all in all it was a great experience. It's not like I was expecting much for 4.99. We have 3 kids and since kids under 4 eat free we fed our family for under $20! The pizza was fresh and hot and they kept different varieties coming out all the time. The tables were clean as were the bathrooms. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would absolutely go back to this location.
truthful,Wanted to try this restaurant as we live nearby and couldn't figure out where to park. Finally we went around to the back and found only valet parking. We went to Rosie McCaffreys instead
truthful,"We chose Vanna to take care of our mature Golden Retriever Cody many times over 7 years ending when Cody passed in early 2016.  Vanna demonstrated such care and love for Cody and we were comforted when we were away knowing he was in the best care.  Vanna has a knack for taking care of multiple dogs at a time, and Cody always had so much fun with her and the other dogs.  She walked her guest dogs many times a day and Cody got more exercise and play than he did with us.  When we returned Cody was always so happy and healthy and he looked like he'd just had a dream 'dogcation'.  Cody would always get excited when we walked towards her place, it was clear he really enjoyed his time with Vanna and her other guest dogs.  Vanna's rates were the lowest in the area too.  If you want your dog get the best exercise, food, love and attention, and a chance to live and play with other dogs (they are pack animals), I very highly recommend Vanna's services.  Cody had a much improved quality of life because of Vanna."
truthful,"First of all, these are amazing cupcakes! A little slice of heaven. Really the best cupcakes I have ever had -and I have had a few:). Secondly, the people that work here are super friendly and responsive.  We had a window for delivery time but when I called to see when they were coming within the timeframe (because we had plans), they changed their delivery route to come to our hotel and worked around our schedule. And they were so gracious about it. The delivery person wouldn't even take a tip.  Class act all the way around."
truthful,"Excellent place with good food, fast service and plenty of screens to watch the game. Prices are affordable and the service was prompt and courteous."
truthful,Stopped here for breakfast excellent service and the food above average.  The place is very nice and comfortable. The waiter kept my coffee cup filled without me having to ask. The prices very reasonable. We came back for a late lunch. Once again the food and service  were excellent. Food portions are generous and appealing. The waiter kept my water glass filled and removed dishes as soon as we were done. In both ocasiones the bill arrived promptly. A very nice place!
truthful,Saturday night a super busy place. The atmosphere is definitely lively. The food was ok I ordered the meatloaf  it came with soggy and greasy onion rings... left them untouched. My partner ordered the pub hamburger with a side of crunchy onion rings... onion rings soggy and limp.  Not a place to recommend.
truthful,"This was probably the best seafood meal I have ever had! And in Pittsburgh!! Who knew? 2 locals on the strip recommended this restaurant when I asked where we should eat atop Mount Washington. They both stated Monterey Bay Fish Grotto.  The drinks were excellent, as was the ambiance. The view was amazing and we weren't even by the window, but elevated to where we could see everything. Incredible! The appetizer was to die for, and the meal itself was superb! I had the parmesan crusted swordfish, my husband had the crabcake with sea scallops, and our daughter had the crabcakes. All were cooked to perfection and plated beautifully. Our server knew what she was talking about and was very helpful in our selections. For dessert, we shared creme brulee and the angel food grilled cheese. Oh my word, talk about delicious! If you don't eat anywhere else in Pittsburgh, this is THE place to try!"
truthful,"First I stay at the Grand every year for CES last year was really nice but this time I am very disappointed with the room and the cleaning crew. When I got to my clean room I was great by the housing keeping. They had just cleaned my room min before I got in. I decided to use the rest room to wash up before hitting g the strip and noticed that the bathroom was clean but on spot. The shower wall had black long women's hair on the wall. I called the front desk to get house keep up to clean it. They did cone and cleaned the rest room, but fit some reason they did not clean the wall were the hair was. I had to call three times before someone would c lean it.   Not very happy with my stay and it's only the first night"
truthful,"My family and I travelled to Montreal for a week, after reading a couple reviews we decided to grab some dinner at this location. We arrived around 5 PM, and it was not busy. We were not greeted or seated for a good 5-10 minutes after walking into the door. The waiter did not seem to know much about the menu or he did not bother to explain any of it to us, we ordered some appetizers. Most of the food was bland with no flavor. Their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls, most likely spring rolls catered for non-asian. Let's see, it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered, but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 20-30 minutes after our mains had still not arrived. So we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take, he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders. He did not put the orders through! This was horrible service and he did not even apologize, he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table. Keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables. It was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course. The pho had the weakest broth I have ever tasted. Everyone else food was either cold or bland. HORRIBLE food and TERRIBLE service."
truthful,"Great for tourists and the food is amazing. They have a wide selection from sandwiches and salads. The service was amazing with such a busy atmosphere, although the seating is a bit crowded the food will not disappoint. This is a must visit place!"
truthful,"If you're a tourist, COME HERE! The service was nothing short than superb, came to Montreal to visit some friends and explore the city, we had a reservation and we greeted kindly as soon as we walked in. Our waiter was friendly and lively, more importantly patient as we had difficult time choosing what to have. We ended up getting quite of bit of food to share among all of us. The food was terrific, the beef tartar was packed with flavor and ask for extra bruschetta because there is only 3 pieces along with the order. Duck poutine and shepherds pie makes my mouth water every time I think about it. Their wine selection was not bad, and had all of the essentials. We had a great time among friends and the staff, and the food with wine is amazing!"
truthful,"Matt is the hardest working and most dedicated worker I have ever met. Every previous worker I have used to clean my dryer vent took the easy route and did a half quality job. Matt squeezed into areas my two year old boy would have trouble getting into just to make sure the job was done correctly, and on top of this is half the price of every other company I called. At the end of the job he told me that he probably saved another dryer fire from occurring and that makes it all worth it. Truly loves his work. I will never call another company again."
truthful,"The Haus of Vapors in Phoenix is by far the Best Vaporizor retailer in AZ!  If you want to quit smoking, new to vaporizing, or just curious about the whole vaporizing experience.....this is the place to go. The owner is awesome and so are his employee's, they all know everything you need to know to get the best education on vaping as well as knowing their customer's needs.  They have the best vaporizing liquids ~ far superior than your regular smoke shop....and very decent prices. The owner takes pride in his shop and it shows!!  From  the name on the building to the interior and the awesome flavorful experience as you try out the flavors!  My fiance and I have been smoker's for 27+ years pack a day or more....tried the patch the gum the meds and nothing worked till we walked into the Haus of Vapor's!  If you are the same get the Snowwolf 200W don't mess around ~ you will be glad you did!!! Experience, Education & Excellence!!!! Phoenix Sprouts Plaza on E. Indian School between  N. 28th and 30th Streets. I F!@#en LOVE Unicorn Puke!!! Raquel & Josh"
truthful,"My rating would be a 5 if it wasn't for the Tom Yum soup. The soup was good, but I've had better. However, their green curry and drunken noodles were outstanding! Spice level and consistency was perfect. They even stayed open late to let us finish our dinner! Fantastic!"
truthful,"So far so good! Service Has been awesome, Beer has been great! The carne asada quesadilla was yummy! The margarita pizza was excellent and the buffalo chicken slider was tasty. I was not impressed with the black angus and pulled pork sliders. The pulled pork turned out to be carne asada and not pork at all, and the angus was only a burger patty. Didn't come with toppings it sauces. Otherwise excellent!"
truthful,"Worst green curry I have ever had. The chicken and vegetables in the curry were good and fresh but the actual curry a Sauce was awful!!! It said it was made with coconut milk, but I'm thinking more like coconut water, or maybe just plain water. It was runny and flavorless! But the spring roll that came with the lunch was good...."
truthful,"Great pizza, friendly staff. First time trying neechis pizza. As a active duty military member pizza is almost part of my everyday diet. I was very impressed with the taste and the amount of toppings the crust had good texture and was very tasty as well but the sause is what made me put them at the top of my list very unique  I haven't come across before in other pizza shops that I've been at across the country  (San Diego, Texas, north chicago,michigan,ohio) I travel alot so I like to get a taste of everyones pizza. And they offered me me a military discount which helps us military guys out thank you neechies."
truthful,"Been coming here for years! They are always so good to my dog, they don't lock him up in a cage for hours, they let him hang out and play with the other dogs. He is always happy and groomed perfectly. The owner/manager is so sweet and always so accommodating. Love this place!"
truthful,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Waited for a half hour didn't get our appetizer, while everyone who was seated after us was served.  The server didn't even get our order until 15-20 mins of being seated. I get its a new restaurant but it shouldn't take that long for our appetizer to get to the table. The manager had to go to the kitchen and get our food that was probably just sitting there. Then when we got our food the waitress came over and said she forgot our onion rings. So upset with the dining experience. Food was alright but still didn't need to take over an hour to get everything to our table. Thought this was a burger place?"
truthful,"This was an excellent restaurant with a great ambience and lovely food. I was in town looking for a great place to eat which would serve fresh food with high quality in reasonable portions, and I stumbled upon this place. The service was great, the food was excellent quality and taste and minimal disruptions. I ordered the kale and arugula salad which I did not realize had bacon on it. The server did not even question my concern and right away replaced the salad for my convenience and satisfaction. I was so impressed at how she did not even question it and said no problem we will just change the for you to make sure you are happy with your food choice. I would really recommend this place"
truthful,Food great. Service horribly. Not enough staff to handle a small amount of customer. Had to wait forever for each step of the process. Be prepared to have to shave again during the meal
truthful,Slow and understaffed.  Looked past me and took known guy behind
truthful,"Always quick and efficient! The price is right, every time I go (probably twice a month) I do the $15 wash, which includes exterior and interior and my car always comes out like new within 15min!"
truthful,"I am not usually a fan of burritos, but wow I am obsessed with their breakfast burrito and all of their pastries are fantastic. I've definitely found my favorite place to grab breakfast or lunch or just a sweet treat!"
truthful,One of my favorite places to get a drink and a great meal largely because you can't bet the beautiful and relaxing atmosphere! You can sit right next to the golf course while watching the sun set over the mountains and service is always fast and friendly
truthful,"Service and atmosphere was really great and had a fun twist on decor. Food came out quickly and the portion size was large. Got the la vaca loca that had the steak. Flavoring was great, but ordered with the green sauce and I didn't really taste or see it in the burrito so maybe it was forgotten? So instead I loaded it with the side of salsa given and side of guacamole that I ordered and omg so good! Salsa and guac was awesome and so fresh. Definitely will be going back for a nice quick lunch"
truthful,This place is absolutely amazing and service outstanding! The atmosphere is relaxing with stunning views which makes this place one I keep coming back to again and again. Prices are completely reasonable and I believe a little cheaper when compared to the other high end spas in the area. The restorative organic massage is my favorite since it uses hot towels to massage your back and includes a scalp massage and foot scrub!
truthful,"Of course the food and drinks were perfect like always! Cocktails are a must and you can't go wrong with any one (especially their Mai Tai). We always do a full meal of appetizer, entree (the snapper, steak salad, or fish tacos are my favorites) and dessert when we go because everything is just so good! Hands down my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale area; you just can't pass up a beach paradise atmosphere in the desert."
truthful,"After shopping around for cushion replacement not only did I get the best price and customer service here, but Valerie even came to my home at no additional charge to measure everything. She even offered to discard the old ones for me & if they're in good enough condition they donate them to dog shelters to be used as beds which is such an amazing idea! They had the best selection of fabrics from different manufactures including Sunbrella, Tommy Bahama, Outdura, and Pindler. Valerie was also really helpful to narrow down choices that helped me stay in budget, but as she mentioned you can start here and the sky's the limit!"
truthful,"Loved the loose leaf tea. Meal wasn't my favorite, but I got an egg dish and apparently they are more known for sweet breakfast dishes such as pancakes etc. The two people I went with both got pancakes and they enjoyed them"
truthful,"I had such high high hopes for this place. Truly. I too toured the facility and I like Marc T was in awe of the facility and the cleanliness everything was so new and properly stored, I felt like if I had to put my baby somewhere this is what I would want.  I did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but I figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and 'breakfast & lunch' so I dove in!!   With MUCH push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week, (you are charged weekly on Fridays) I chose to put my child on an easy-pay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition Mistake 1. The first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee (183 for 3 days mon, wed, fri & 150 enrollment) then no less than 3 days later they charged us again! This being our first week my husband and I were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke,  after addressing the issue with  Kaylee we were told ""no worries, well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week"" great I thought lets move forward then 3 days later ANOTHER charge now I was getting a little annoyed.  I don't know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge. Again I went to the office and spoke with Angela the finance director and I told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment. I kindly asked for a refund as I didn't mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up, I was more than a little peeved about the other charges. I talked to Selena and she told me that I needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the charges...Lol I wasn't lying. Don't they keep records of what they are charging peoples cards!! Angela tells me SUUUUURE you can have a refund in 6-8 weeks!!!! 6-8 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight? I snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut!!!   So I let it go AGAIN (really didn't have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges) I continued to bring my son. When I would pick up my son the room was so hot I could smell the children's sweat but this is AZ heat so I figured man the AC must be working hard to keep this place cool and I would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on.  One of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio, were talking 15 KIDS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER!!!! Why? because that's the minimum that the state will allow wouldn't you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum? It was a ZOO when I would have to get him early. There was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time. Great! I thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age. They called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy, when I went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy I was very upset he had never hit before, when I walked in he was sitting alone (I assume time out) which I am okay with but when I asked if the little boy was okay I looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle, not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5!!! They are learning they are going to get into scuffs.  My son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead I didn't say anything because I get it, they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough. After the 2nd time I chose to remove him from the program, just in time in my opinion I just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies. Lol Across the hall from my sons class was the infant room, my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them. As a mother I know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they aren't required to have more teachers in the class?. It just made me so sad to see this daily.     The staff is SUPER UNFRIENDLY I actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at them!!  In conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following:  1. Your child must NEVER make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid, if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him  2. Have an endless supply of money because they will need it. 150 enrollment, 150 for 'supplies' ( must be for the starbucks) plus tuition  3. must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave.  4.Must be able to figure out their plans they don't tell you crap till day of!  UPDATE: The school asked that I remove this post.....ugh I think not!!!!"
truthful,"I've been taking route 57 - Courtney Park for the past 6 years and it's been a disaster. This route operates only every half an hour during rush hours and even that is with lots of problems.   - sometime one bus doesn't show up AT ALL - there is never any action taken to accommodate for the problems on the route or with the bus breaks down  - the bus stops, either in terminal or even enroute have no shelter and waiting so long in cold winters is not fun!"
truthful,The water for the shower was not hot enough. The rooms are pretty old and our refrigerator was faulty. Not the best place to stay.
truthful,"The service throughout the night was inconsistent.  I asked how the shrimp was prepared.  The server said, ""medium, we prepare all of our fish medium."" Uncooked shrimp? No thanks.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, ""it will be out but I don't have a time to give you.""  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, ""yes, I thought that it didn't look right.""  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, ""I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check.""  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.  Unfortunately, this restaurant was a big let down."
truthful,"Had the Giglio pasta tonight. It was AMAZING! I usually don't write reviews, but I felt this dish exceeded expectations. Service was excellent!! Appreciate the attentiveness to our two children present as well. Thanks for making it a nice night out!"
truthful,"Learned about the establishment by chance.  I went to the Craig location and was blown away by the quality of the poke.  I was so stoked when I learned that they have a South location. The customer service is superb and you can sample all the different poke. Personally I like the spicy ahi poke, salmon with special sauce. This is definite must try"
truthful,"Recently I have been searching for a window cleaning service for my new business.  Out of all the companies I called, this was the only one who answered their phone.  As scheduled he came on time got the job done very quickly.  I was suprised at the difference in appearance after getting our windows cleaned.  To top it all off, he was very affordable.  Highly recommended."
truthful,Great service.... The food is phenomenal they have a restaurant connected to it so you get restaurant quality food. Only caveat is to make sure you make reservation early since the place can be packed
truthful,"Great service, reasonable prices, could not be happier with Robert and his services!"
truthful,We are extremely happy with the timeliness and the quality of the service Chris provided.
truthful,"Needed a ""Schedule B"" service on my 2014 E350....knew the dealer would be expensive but would probably get the job done with minimal hassle.  More than pleasantly surprised with the quality and timeliness of the work.  But what compelled me to give a five star rating was the final bill.  When I picked up the car I was told I needed a new ""pollen filter"" and a new ""air filter"".  I was hoping it would be just an oil and oil filter change, but Carlos told me they needed to be changed.  I was shocked when he handed me the bill and it was at the estimated price. I asked about the filters, and he told me they were able to change them and honor the original estimated price.  This has never happened to me at a car service place ever.  Never ever.  I am a very satisfied customer.  They did the work at a fair price, and well under the dealer price.  Could not have asked for more."
truthful,"Second trip to Frank's, and it is always a very good experience.  Frank is beyond fair, the work is top-notch, and both times the car was delivered on-time as promised.  They get my highest recommendation as getting your car repaired is not the most pleasant task in the world, but Frank makes it as painless as possible.  Everybody in the shop has a great attitude."
truthful,I love the lemon pepper chicken with fried okra and feta spinach. Yum yum yum! I wish it were open more hours.
truthful,Not delicious. I wanted it to be but it wasn't. Firecracker shrimp didn't have good flavor. Looked like some college guy's sad first attempt at stir fry. I'll never eat here again.
truthful,This place is beyond amazing. My boyfriend took me here for the first time a month ago. By far the best tacos ever...
truthful,"Great place right on the Capitol Square. Very good food and good beer selection. Pretty good prices as well. Expect to pay anywhere from $8-$10 for a sandwich/burger with side. Didn't end up having the fried cheese curds like other people recommend but they did look delicious!  Only gripes for this place are that you can expect to wait a while for a table and they do not take reservations. Second, when it gets busy the service can be slightly spotty and it seemed to take a while to get our food.  It's such a great place though that's probably why it's so busy!"
truthful,Another great staple of Madison that is a must try. Food is very good and beer is of course good. You can get free popcorn for the table. Order food and drinks at the bar and they bring it out to you.  The outside seating area is awesome too in both summer and fall. A must try if you are going through Madison.
truthful,"Came here in the winter (January) and still had a lovely time! Walked around the outside areas where we were told the things to see included grasses and bark.....  Who doesn't love a conservatory in winter? Nice steamy walk through an area teeming with life! Great variety of plants and trees to see along with some birds (mostly quail). For some reason I'm a sucker for pitcher plants, for which there were a number for me to see around the conservatory. Would definitely like to come back in spring/summer."
truthful,"This is a fun place in Madison to come hang out especially on Fridays or weekends. Was pretty packed this past Friday when I went and at first was kind of too much craziness. Luckily we had reserved seats and people seemed to settle down after the first couple innings as lines for beer and food shortened considerably.  Love the beer that they have here. Lots of Great Dane brews and more common craft brews. Food is pretty good with burgers, brats, pulled pork, chicken, fries, slaw, potato salad all available.  Would recommend paying the $5 for the reserved seating in advance though the only drawback is that this is not like a picnic table so it is a bit hard to have a group there in reserved seats and all be comingling unless you are getting up a lot. Regardless, this is still a fun time and it shows by how packed it gets."
truthful,"It is pricey for the average golfer but if you are an avid one who appreciates good golf courses and experiences, this is a great choice. Played the Desert and Canyon courses which were both in very good shape. Cool layouts with some challenges including some tight holes. Overall though this is a very beautiful course on SE side of Camelback Mountain.   Only criticism is that we got out early on the Desert course and played pretty quickly only to get stuck behind a whole bunch of groups at the turn going to the Canyon course. The ranger/time starter guys couldn't exactly explain why that happened.  Overall though this is a great course with nice amenities. Grass tees. GPS in cart. Would definitely come play again."
truthful,"Course was in great shape and is reasonably priced for a TPC course. This is a fun course to play but is very tight! Great location right at the Marriott in Scottsdale and is convenient to get to from most places.  The people were friendly except for one guy in the pro shop. Interestingly the 18th hole is the only one where there were some quality issues as the fairway and green were not in as good of shape as the rest of the course.  All in all though, I would definitely return."
truthful,The only knock I have on this course is that it is a bit pricey (which is a common complain of mine). But overall this was a great course and a great experience.  We played in late December so there was a frost delay but once we got off it was sunny and not very cold. The group in front of us was playing a bit slow from the outset and by the third hole the ranger was on them to speed up (which they did).  Course is playable for many skill levels. My group played the tips and are above average golfers and we enjoyed our experience a lot. It was not an overly challenging course but still required skill. Very professionally run course with 3 separate nines (we played Ironhead and Acacia).   Course was in good shape and greens rolled true. Only additional complaint would be that the restaurant was under construction and not open for another month or so and when we went to the only other shop which had food they were out of some different beers and other items (which they had on display and made it seem like they did have them available).  I would return.
truthful,Not much to complain about here. Good food on the east side of Madison with a good beer and drinks menu. I had the bison burger which was fantastic and got the side of cucumber cilantro quinoa. People I was with had skirt steak (again delicious) with garlic mashed potatoes (you guessed it....delicious).   Very nice wait staff and good homey kind of place. If I lived in Madison I would definitely come back to this place as a staple.
truthful,This course is on the less expensive end of the scale for Scottsdale which still means fairly pricey (I believe it was around $80-$90 per person in prime season in end of March?). There is no driving range but we went to one of the courses nearby beforehand which wasn't very far away.  Overall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout. Greens in good shape. Course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward. Got out at 8:45 or so and played pretty quickly. Would definitely come back for more.
truthful,"Found this place on Yelp while I was on vacation in Scottsdale so figured we would try it out and it was wonderful!  The service was great and there wasn't really anyone else there when we went so Arturo stopped by and offered us some of the Habanero Tequila (apparently he makes it). WOW it was hot. Not really for me but very interesting and awfully cool of him to come out and offer us some.  Food was great! I had three different tacos (Calimarii, Blackened Fish, and Carnitas) and all were awesome!. Other people in my party got blackened fish entree, the carnitas entree, the carne asada entree. Everyone was happy!  Friendly people and great food. Pricing was very reasonable too. My tacos were $2.50/$2.99 each and most entrees were in the $6-$9.50 range.  Would definitely return!"
truthful,Cool distillery/bar east of Madison. Didn't really see a lot of the distillery but mainly there is a drinking room. They have a menu of different cocktails. Was there on a Saturday around 6 and it was fairly busy.  Pricing is pretty good - generally $6 per mixed drink. Try the Honey-Cap!
truthful,"Always hard to judge how strenuous a hike is from reading reviews cause you don't know people's fitness levels. This will definitely present a challenge for people that don't exercise much as the first part is fairly steep and continues for probably about 30-45 minutes. We took the trail up to Tom's Thumb and back which took at least 2 hours round trip. We started early like some recommended to take advantage of shade on the first part of the trail at that time of day and it was a great idea.   The trail itself though is very nice aesthetically with great views and an interesting path. The trail to Tom's Thumb is pretty well marked. The view from Tom's Thumb is great and you marvel at seeing the trailhead parking lot off in the distance, seeing where you started from."
truthful,"Great Mexican place in downtown Madison just off State Street. This place strikes you as very authentic (perhaps it was something about the luchador fights on TV in the restaurant with the Spanish commentary).  Food was awesome. Had tostadas and gorditas which were both fantastic (chorizo, steak, pastor (pork) - can't go wrong!). You can buy individual tostadas or gorditas for $3.50/$3 each though there are lots more options. Also had this amazing drink that was like milk with cinnamon toast crunch flavoring. Definitely check that out."
truthful,"Been to the Dane County Farmer's Market more times than I can count over the years. What an awesome event every Saturday. Atmosphere is wonderful. The market extends around all 4 sides of the Capitol.   Highlights of the market are the wonderful fresh food, trying all the awesome cheese samples (curds, fried cheese, aged cheese, etc.). Doesn't get much better than the fried cheese. Great pastries/bakery items too - hot and spicy cheese break, donuts, muffins, scones, etc. I've also bought vegetable plants from the market and they've seemed to turn out better than ones you buy from home depot or somewhere like that.  Truly an awesome place. Lots of people though and if you get there after 10 it is pretty crazy busy. More like a crawl around the Capitol."
truthful,I'm always surprised at how hard it is to find good Pad Thai but this was always good. Service was usually good. I would do both sit down and carry out and had good experiences with both.  Mainly remember this place for the solid Pad Thai. Nice people. Cash only.
truthful,"Saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and had to come try the brioche french toast. We went on a week day and it wasn't very crowded. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food that I was with (people got omelet, the Wolfpack (hash browns with eggs and bacon in between more hash browns) though noone thought it was outstanding.  The brioche french toast I had came with caramelized bananas and pecans and I had to ask for more bananas because I literally was brought 3-4 small slices of banana on top of my french toast and the pecans were all bits and pieces. To their credit, they brought me out a lot more bananas and they were caramelized and in the caramel sauce.  I would definitely return."
truthful,"This place is nice but nothing outstanding. If you are looking for a place to go and get pampered this is not the place for you. The pool is nice and the hot tub is pretty large and awesome.    The only restaurant on the premises is a small snack shop by the pool which has sandwiches and such. The rooms have kitchens which provide what you need if you want to make your own food while you are there. There is a breakfast provided from 8-8:45 two days a week which is nice but isn't out for long after the 8:45 end time. During that time you are presented different activities and excursion type stuff you can do in the area.  The concierge is definitely helpful as they recommended a good breakfast place (though there are others) and helped us get a tee time at a discounted rate at a nice course nearby.  Assuming you have a car, going to Sedona is a must and is a pretty drive up there. Also interesting if you are adventurous and are comfortable driving on unpaved roads in the mountains is driving the Apache Trail which goes out to Tonto National Forest and Roosevelt Lake.  I would likely go somewhere else if I went back to Scottsdale as I wasn't blown away by the place, but it depends what type of vacation you are looking for. The place was clean but the maid service didn't really do much."
truthful,"Oh! This place is soooooo gooooooooood. Brunch buffet is absolutely ridiculous - prime rib on Sunday, every kind of breakfast food you can imagine, for a little extra you get all you can drink mimosas, cinnamon rolls are awesome.  For dinner I was a huge fan of the cheddar burger (you get a ton of shredded cheddar on top) and the prosciutto pizza. Beer was great too.  Service is typical. Decent prices. Food is fricking awesome."
truthful,"This place rocks. Would come here very often if I still lived in Madison. Everything from the food, to the setup, to the d√©cor is awesome. Not been to many places where you go to find more seating upstairs and it basically feels like you just got home. There are tables and then a whole loft-style area with couches and comfy chairs where people can hang out. But in an authentic way, not the forced Starbucks kind of way.  The food is stellar. Got the chorizo skillet which was amazing. My part also indulged in blueberry and raspberry scones which were awesome (taking cues from the other recommendations). I enjoyed a nice hazelnut coffee and then got the free refill! Also loved how you can take jars of preservatives/jam to your table to which were also delicious."
truthful,Went for the tour and drinking on a summer Saturday. Pretty nice little Saturday! Tour is $5 and they just take you through the warehouse and some of the brewing area. It isn't anything overly special. If you've been on other brewery tours before it is a pretty standard one.  Beer I great though. With the $5 tour you get a small tasting glass and three different tastings. They have the staples along with more seasonal and experimental type brews. Pretty reasonable prices too if you want beers/pitchers also (which you will). Pitchers are generally around $11.
truthful,worst cup cakes ever - my husband and i tried the salted caramel and the peanut butter and chocolate and they were both very dry and heavy. There was no hint of salt with the salted caramel cupcake.
truthful,Excellent service and results. Always prompt and we receive a call from our regular provider Dean the day before he comes to ensure the time is convenient.
truthful,"So, after my walk from whalburger, which is in an earlier review, also amazing, we headed to the fuel bar.  Professional flaretenders.  Sooshey and the guys throw up a mean cocktail with some sick tricks to go with it.  I have been to places where flare was the theme but the drinks tasted like sweaty nut water, but here, the drinks were amaze balls!!! I suggest getting the Moscow mule, and try to find the bogo coupons they have floating around."
truthful,"Wow, best dang burger!!! Get the beast, omergerd!!! This is the pot of gold at the end of a dark and contaminated rainbow.  After a long night of being humped and grinded on by degenerate girls full of plastic and daddy issues, this was my nirvana.  It tasted better than the silicon titty that was in my mouth the night before. I only wish it were in Dallas."
truthful,"Hands down the BEST sushi I have ever had with a lot of great options to choose from, and the customer service to match it... but you will pay for it"
truthful,"Got $1000 worth of tires today. They told me it would be a long wait & they'd call me when done. I waited from noon till 3pm. The tires were done @ 1:45 pm. They said they were too busy to call. 3hrs for the guy in front of me for a flat tire fix. When he complained Erick his service guy said ""Thank you"" with a smirk and walk away. Don't recommend them. The change in staff since the last few tire sets I purchased is quite noticeable. They need customer service training."
truthful,"I was kind of hesitant when I seen that a Thrift Boutique was coming to the neighborhood. But when I chose to stop in; it was a pleasurable experience; very upper class. They have clothing (men, woman, children) some sporting, kitchen, baby items. Great condition, some prices could be lower, but over all not too bad. I've been in twice; looking forward to going back to see what is new."
truthful,"I recently moved to the area and was looking to get my oil changed on my vehicles. Walked in and spoke to Carlos.......he was very helpful and polite. Made an appointment for both my vehicles. Got everything I needed and was updated on when and how often I needed to do further maintenance. Carlos shared with me what type of oil to use, spark plugs ect...........NO one had ever done that before. I was actually treated like a person and not a female who didn't know anything. This was a GREAT experience; will highly recommend. Oh, and something else I didn't expect............I now have an online garage where I can keep track of my maintenance and they offer coupons too! WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
truthful,"Nice atmosphere, good service, and quality food at a great price. I know this sounds really gimmicky, but I'm a real customer. I'm just getting straight to the point!"
truthful,"I thought maybe this was a hidden gem, not at all! Food was okay, space is very dank, service was horrible! My dinner counterpart did not like her meal, the waitress' response: Sorry. After asking the item to be removed from the bill the waitress and owner literally argued with us since she had taken a few bites (how else can you tell you do/don't like something). A few days later, I'm noticing they ran my debit card twice. NEVER AGAIN!"
truthful,"This place is true to its name. I agree with some of the other ratings I've read about the friendly staff, good machines, and comfortable environment. Only downfalls are that the WIFI doesn't always connect to my PC and that they don't do alterations w/ dry cleaning. I can def overlook those things, however. Oh, and I LOVE that the machines accept debit/credit cards: note that it'll automatically take about $15 dollars out though, then comp the difference afterwards."
truthful,TR Lawing handled my business very professionally. The only recommendation would be to improve contact accessibility. Thank you.
truthful,"I went here with my wife for a spur of the moment date night. The club itself is very nice and the staff was great. We shared the pickle fries and spinach artichoke dip, which were both very good. We even got to witness someone literally spit their entire drink up from laughing so hard. Overall a great place to hang out and laugh your ass off"
truthful,"Cheap prices but I'd rather pay full price for decent food.  Calamari was greas instead of crispy, served on a bed of tomato sauce rather than dipping sauce.   Prime rib sliders tasted like the meat had spent the last week in the refrigerator before being served.   Last was the tenderloin skewers , my wife ate them as I had lost my appetite...she said the best part was the sauteed spinach they were served on. Ya, they shoved a wooden skewer into 3 chunks of random shaped  over cooked salty meat.  Waitress was very nice and was sure to remind me how cheap the bill was, I guess so I would't stiff on the tip.  My beer was nice & cold ...I should have stopped there."
truthful,"Excellent food, a wide variety of different pasta, seafood, steaks.  The etouffee was delicious with plenty of sauce to rice ratio.  The chicken alfredo was more than enough for a hungry 7 year old. The finale was the chocolate mouse cake!  The service was excellent thanks to the waitress Melissa!  Great date place with table cloths and cloth napkins and a chilled fork for your salad."
truthful,"Was very helpful.  We had a session on finaces and preparing for future retirement.  The consultent/coach encouraged me where needed, and gave good advice.  Please try out the services!"
truthful,I should have checked the box before I got home. I ordered for pickup. I understand this is a pizza place but I paid over $10 for 5 burnt chicken fingers and 10 burnt fries. I LITERALLY counted 10 fries. How was that acceptable to serve on a plate as a cook and then as a cashier how could you let someone walk out with that? I was so hungry and too pissed to go back when I got home. Extremely disappointed with the sky pointe location.
truthful,"Keith was my sales rep he was awesome. I had to take care of a busted iPhone 6plus screen and decided to just ditch the iPhone all together. I was totally prepared to turn the iPhone in and get the 80$ credit so I wouldn't have to deal with fixing it. Keith explained ALL of my options and I had a clear understanding of what I was getting. I switched from Verizon, WAS VERY IMPORTANT I KEEP MY NUMBER.. he transferred my  contacts(offered to transfer photos if needed), had the screen protector put on my phone. The best part is he did all of this in 20 MINUTES.   Everyone at this store was extremely professional and friendly. Keith understood what I needed and I felt comfortable about making the switch from Verizon after 14 years!!! Nicholas and Robbi (sp?) were knowledgeable and professional as well.  Thanks again. I left the store feeling like I got exactly what I needed and was looking for.   If you're looking for an EFFICIENT FAST professional you can trust, I would go to this location."
truthful,"This was honestly the best time I've ever had getting my photo taken!  My last passport photo was taken at a Black's, and was so bad that customs agents actually laughed every time they saw it.  In comparison, I actually look so much better in this photo than I do in real life! John (the owner) absolutely adores what he does. From the second I walked in, he had nothing but compliments for me. He gives you the option to choose from multiple poses, and then takes the best one and does some slight Photoshop magic to make it even better. He then prints it while you wait.  Cash only - all in, it cost $7.90 for 2 passport photos with the official stamp, and he threw in an additional one ""for my mom"".   Overall, it took 10 minutes for the whole ""experience"", but it also never felt rushed. I'm tempted to go back to get other random photos taken, just because he made me feel so good about myself! Be sure to ask him about the time he was in a movie with Mark Wahlberg - he has the photos to prove it!"
truthful,The food was good and our bartender Rob made excellent drinks. Everything was made well and the prices were even better! Rob was also very friendly. Great bartender.
truthful,I made my husband try some Jell-O shots and he was buzzed off of just a few of them. Great little place for booze!
truthful,We have been coming here for years for sushi. Andy is a sushi master and we love him! Sit at the sushi bar and he will make you something custom based on what you like or dislike. He is incredible!!!!
truthful,Their black beans are to die for! I could live off of them. I recommend just getting take out because the seating area isn't the greatest. It is cafeteria style.
truthful,"Love the atmosphere here! Shattered chips are delicious, we took our leftovers of them home and added buffalo sauce and they were even better! The chef came outside and asked how our meal was and the manager also stopped by. You never see this at smaller restaurants so that was a great perk! WE had the Paris Texas Burger and the chicken sandwich, both amazing! Would recommend to everyone!"
truthful,"Can't say enough good things about this place...food is fabulous, staff is fabulous! I can't get enough of their peanut butter cookies and Thai chicken salad...yum!!!"
truthful,"Had dinner there last night and everything was spectacular. The ambiance and architecture of the restaurant is super hip. Looking forward to sitting on the patio too. Our server Joy was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and helped us pair our drinks with the food we ordered. We had some oysters, the Avocado salad, Salmon and the Radio Milano pasta dish and it all tasted delicious. Their cocktail list is really inventive and yummy! This is definitely going to be the new hot spot in Arcadia!!! Can't wait to go back and try more of the food and drinks!"
truthful,"We have visited this place multiple times over the past few years and when I found out they had a private room for me and my guests I was so excited! At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?  My BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations. I sure hope the lack of customer service turns people off from dining here, you are better off going to Cheesecake Factory!"
truthful,"We tried the Coronado Cafe last night, and it exceeded our expectations.  The ambience was lovely, service excellent, and the food was fabulous.  Their meatloaf (this is NOT your mother's meatloaf) has to be the best on the planet.  We will definitely return."
truthful,"They responded to my inquiry promptly and were friendly and accommodating. Excellent service. Brittany was great and did her utmost to find a time for my wife to be tattooed by Sausage. While that sentence out of context sounds odd, we are looking forward to it in the future, but maybe in 2018."
truthful,"While it's been nearly a year since I had a fabulous dinner at Michael Mina, I still think about the amazing meal I had.  It was my first trip to Las Vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress. By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.  We were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.  Service was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or ""over-styling."" Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.  I'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.  It's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu!"
truthful,"Carnevino is definitely a meat-lovers joy - but maybe a little over-priced for what you get.  My boyfriend is a carnivore and steak-addict, to the point where his friends recommended he come here.  We started with the Beef Tasting Menu, and while the crudo was well done, my issue was so many places seem to do a raw Kobe appetizer. Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and ""beefy and meaty,"" but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak. I preferred the dry aged to the wet...the wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison.   We veered off course a bit - my boyfriend wanted MORE meat and we ordered the dry-aged bone in Rib-Eye for 2. I didn't eat much as my boyfriend devoured it, but the meat was flavorful for sure...just not my style. Ending with the tasting menu desert, which I can't remember because it was so generic. I think creativity could have been a lot better.  Service was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat.   Lastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative.   If you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your. But I prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isn't the place for it. I will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than I did. Otherwise, maybe try another, more diverse restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian Restaurant row."
truthful,"Amazing steak and other food, but be prepared for a slight bit of wallet shock.  I made reservations at CUT back in May while visiting LV, but due to an unfortunate bout of illness (DO NOT EAT DUCK FRIED RICE FROM THE BELLAGIO POKER ROOM)  that required hospitalization, I was forced to give my reservations to my friends. The next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. I knew that next time I was in Las Vegas, I would need to go.  What luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a WSOP event, and we returned to Las Vegas and made another reservation at CUT for mid June.  We were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. We knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and I have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward iPad wine list. She helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires.   After ordering our wine, we got down to business. For appetizers, we had the Kobe sashimi and the Roasted Beets with goat cheese. They actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us.   For our main courses, I chose the American Wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. I love Kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste I would expect for a $130 steak. My boyfriend chose the New York Sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged American sirloin, American Wagyu, and NZ Wagyu. He ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were THICK) and they were epic. Just meaty and buttery at the same time. My steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven.   For sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. To be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony!   After some excessive meat consumption, I saw a souffle float by to another table. I had to dig deep down, but I never regretted the chocolate souffle. It was rich but airy at the same time. I didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best I've had. The small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.  The service was extremely attentive and water refills/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (Yes, the bread was that good too). My one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. The overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like I was in an HGTV show instead of a restaurant.  When I think steakhouse, I think a little more comfortable and a little less ""sleek."" That said, I also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, I like to eat my food without blinding. If you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.  Overall, I recommend CUT if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal."
truthful,"Great hotel with fabulous services and restaurant - just what Phoenix needs!  We stayed here for a few days after trying to find a place to stay in Phoenix that WASN'T a chain or a massive resort for a decent price and were very pleased to find the Clarendon Hotel.  The room we stayed in was CLEAN, large and comfortable, and the bed was fantastic. The Keurig in the room was a great plus along with the provided robes. My only complaint about the room was the tiiiiiiny bathroom. However, the great pool and hot-tub in the main courtyard really made the stay even better and we enjoyed chatting with other guests while enjoying a cocktail or beer from Gallo Blanco (which incidentally, is also fantastic!).  My biggest issue was the ""resort fee."" I really deplore the addition of the resort fee tacked on after you check in - PLEASE just include this in the regular price of a room when you check in...but also, this isn't reaaaaaaally a resort, so why such an outrageous ""resort fee?"" Still, fee and all, the Clarendon Hotel is worth it, and provided us with a great place to stay in Phoenix."
truthful,"This was the place I was most looking forward to eating at in Vegas. I'm sad to say I was disappointed.   The food was amazing, but the atomosphere and service were way below the the prices they charge. It felt like a cheap club with fantastic food. Very disconnected. Our server was condecending. She seemed annoyed we didn't order ""enough"" (she'd recommended 2-3 cold dishes, 2-3 hot dishes, and 2 sushi rolls) but that was our choice. We'd had a late lunch.   If you just want good food, I'd recommend saving your money and going elsewhere. If you're a 20 or 30-something and want a party atmosphere and don't care about the bill, this could be fun for you."
truthful,"I had high hopes for Craftsteak, and it definitely delivered. Fantastic food in a classy yet unpretentious environment, and amazing service.   Some notes:  -We ordered the cheaper steaks on the menu, and they were AMAZING. Melt in your mouth. Hard to imagine how good the Waygu and other pricey ones would be. But don't feel like you'll be shortchanged by ordering the cheaper ones.  -Don't skip salads. The fava bean salad was the best thing I ate. Who knew a salad could be so good.  -Sit at the bar before dinner if you have time. Our reservation was running a bit late, so we had a drink. The bartenders make the most delicious, strong drinks.   If you love steak and want a classy dinner in Vegas, go here! You won't be disappointed."
truthful,"Ate at China Poblano when I was in Vegas last week and hadn't looked at any Yelp reviews prior. I'm surprised to find it only has 3 stars on here. I thought it was AMAZING. Most importanly, it was priced appropriately, unlike so many places in Vegas.  Some notes:  -The atmosphere was fun (decor is amazing!) -Service was great -Food was creative and delicious -A few dishes were a miss (a noodle soup with the word ""ugly"" in the name), but most were spot on.  -Mexican food was slightly better than the Chinese, but that makes sense given Jose's backgound.  -The salt-air margaritas are genius."
truthful,Worst chiropractor ever I have a pending lawsuit for an injury that was aggravated by this man. Please see your regular doctor to avoid injury from this fraudulent man.
truthful,"My boyfriend & I went to Jozo yesterday after the gym and thought to check this place out since we've been seeing a lot of hype. The place is nice and quiet. Menu has a good variety of options from boba to coffee to smoothies.   We ordered two drinks which was the Classic Taiwanese Milk Tea and the Signature Thai Tea. Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants. And the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba place.  What was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink! My boyfriend and I took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice! The 12oz cup (not even the bottle) was filled with 2/3 ice & 1/3 tea. I know it's being nit picky but I feel like I got gypped paying $4.50. Mind you, they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup - no name or anything.   Overall, I think Jozo is jumping in with the trend of hipster branding but is lacking quality on the flavor. Wish I had a better experience!"
truthful,This family owned gym is a wonderful part of the community and its owners are salt of the earth. Joe Karstadt promotes good citizenship and respectful competitiveness in his students. I recommend JSK to students young and old.
truthful,This is the second time I've come to Just Brakes for an oil change. Fast professional service. Very pleased.
truthful,"You're not gonna find a much better breakfast in this city ... or anywhere really. Breakfast is breakfast, but they do it right and its delicious every time.  Get the lyonnaise potatoes with your meal. They're delicious. My personal favorite is the Tex Mex omelette. Guacamole at breakfast time never fails.  The boardgames on the walls are cute too. :)"
truthful,"Although the staff are very nice and the facility can accomodate a lot of people at once (ease of appointment times), I must say I was not thrilled by this place. The physical therapists are helpful, but compared to other places, are not attentive enough because they are often seeing many patients at once. I thought the service was very good until I visited other physical therapists that give much more one-on-one time and assess your progress much more closely.  Example: I was often left to do my stretches with the therapists mostly coming back to give me something else to do. Besides asking how I felt from time to time, they did not reassess my abilities to walk or stretch as other therapists have. How do they know what is working if they don't assess your progress?"
truthful,"I have both eaten in and taken out with a positive experience.   From walking by, it doesn't look like the greatest place, but they have an interesting menu with different asian/asian fusion dishes so there's a little bit for everyone from the exotic to the simple.  The Malaysian Sate, which I had with beef, was delicious and came in a more than adequately sized portion. The Pad Thai is also a delicious meal. All of the appetizers and other dishes I tried were more than satisfactory.   For a student on a budget, this place is both delicious and relatively inexpensive. I would recommend it to anyone who likes interesting tastes of Asia."
truthful,"I was excited to visit the PBC solely to experience their ""exotic"" types of burger meat. I chose the salad bar option, which was poorly stocked. The selection did not look all that appetizing.  When ordering burgers, the first selections that we made were not available so I settled on a Bison Burger. It was not much to speak of from the bun to the toppings or even the meat itself. It wasn't memorable or particularly tasty. The french fries I tried seemed overdone and like they had been sitting out.  Frankly. I would not recommend this place. My meal left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. The food was not that good and the service also left something to be desired. The restaurant was a little dark, uncomfortable booths, and didn't have a nice atmosphere.... If you're in the area, you'd be better off at Red Robin,"
truthful,"Seviche has a lively, colorful atmosphere that added to the dining experience. Our server was very attentive and knew the menu very well. She was able to offer many suggestions. The rest of the wait staff was also helpful when it came to seating us, turning the air down, everything.  Served tapas style, the food is conducive to sharing and ordering lots of little things. We tried for all ranges of the menu and thought the dishes had interesting flavor profiles, were prepared well, and tasted great.  The seviche section allows you to choose a fish and a style of preparation -- they are delicious! The filet mignon was also a wonderful cut of meat.  Mojitos are a bit pricey at $9 a drink for the small glasses they are in, but are delicious all the same."
truthful,"Fun atmosphere. Good food. Big beers.  I would suggest the appetizer sampler (the works). As many below me will agree, the sauerkraut balls are delicious. The bier cheese & pretzels were good too.  I had the Bayerischer Schweinsbraten (pork with sauerkraut and a potato dumpling). It was different than I expected as I'm not too familiar with German food, but still pretty good. The pork was cooked well and had a good sauce. I wish I had substituted mashed potatoes instead of the dumpling."
truthful,A big menu selection with even bigger size portions (so big I took half of my sandwich home). I thought my meal was delicious and was impressed with the amount of sandwich/burger options on the menu that I was torn between.  Definitely a place to check out in Southside.
truthful,"The times I have been here I was impressed at the food and service in comparison to a Red Robin I had visited several years ago. We were seated quickly and taken care of by the wait staff.  I had the Prime Chophouse Burger and the Burnin' Love Burger on two separate occasions. My food came out hot, fresh, and cooked to my liking. The fries were all newly made.   Because it is a chain, you know going in that you won't be gettin extravagant food, but for a burger & fries kind of meal there are a lot of choices, many of which are good."
truthful,"Self-service frozen yogurt with tons of toppings to choose from. You pay by weight, although there are no prices listed.  They change out the flavors and have some seasonal type ones too. The frozen yogurt is really delicious and I would highly recommend coming here. Their toppings include fruit, gummy worms/bears, sprinkles, chocolate, sauces, cereal, etc..."
truthful,"On the multiple occasions that I have gone to this restaurant, I have always had a positive and very-filling experience.   Their bread is delicious and hot. The server always brings out tons for us. I would say most of the dishes are standard Italian fare. I have not been disappointed by the Pasta Bravo, Eggplant Parm, or the side salads.  The best thing I have tried here was the Chicken Scaloppini. The chicken is covered in melted cheese and has a great lemon sauce. I would highly, highly recommend this dish.  For dessert, try the apple turnover thing with ice cream. You won't be disappointed."
truthful,"I had a banquet event here and I was quite impressed with the service, as well as the atmosphere. The wait staff was very friendly and was able to keep everyone's order straight, despite the large group.  I ordered a chicken dish that had a creamy sauce, some potatoes, and asparagus. It was a great dish, served hot. It had way more complex flavors than I was expecting. I also tried a bite of the pasta with vegetables.  In a catered, sit down dinner service, I usually don't expect the food to be great or hot, but the Grand Concourse is a nice exception."
truthful,"Ice cream is made on the premises with a variety of traditional and very unique flavors. Walking past these place you can smell the waffle cones and sweet treats that are made behind their doors. Definitely a place to check out.  Negatives:   Cash only. I think they have a machine where you can take out money through an atm-like transaction, but it does charge.  Although delicious and I swear by it, I think their ice cream is a little over-priced."
truthful,"Pita Pit is a more interesting version of Subway, to me. You can pick from a variety of meats, cheeses, veggies, and sauces. Its inexpensive and tasty.  The staff was friendly and made the experience even better."
truthful,"I ordered take out from here and was happy with my order.   I had a white pizza with spinach and it was really delicious and filling. The man who made the pizza was Italian, which adds an element of authenticity. The pizza was a far size, for a far price.   It's a nice change from the other pizza options in Oakland."
truthful,"Having eaten here several times, I was unsure between 3 and 4 stars as some visits/meals were better than others. Pretty solid fare, bar food type. Not the best atmosphere inside - kind of dark, gets a bit loud, still enjoyable though.  Highly Recommended: Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese  Skinny Dip (Buffalo Chicken Dip with Chips) Hog Heaven, especially because of the side horseradish sauce. Russet/Sweet Potato Fry Mix  Average: Rosemary's Breast Burger Salads (in general)  They are known for having great pizzas, but I've only ever had a bite here and there.  Half price after 11 is always super crowded. Good happy hour beer prices.  When getting takeout, I do feel the portions are smaller."
truthful,"I had the Bistro Burger with a side order of french fries. The burger was brought out to my table and I found it be simple, but delicious. The fries were hot and had a nice salt & pepper seasoning.  Although I did not try the salad, it looked great -- a ton of options, friendly staff to help you with your selections. Once you pick everything, they chop it and give you dressing. The salad was what I thought to be a big portion, much bigger than Panera and customized to what you want.  This is a great concept. I'm sure the place will do well. I'm told at lunch the line is already out the door and its not even the school year yet...  Its also nice how they have garage style doors at the front to keep a nice breeze coming through and leave the place feeling more open."
truthful,"Great subs, bottom line.  Fresh bread, a large variety of choices, hot or cold.  Yum, yum, yum."
truthful,I've been to Dean of Shadyside on several occasions now. I have always had a pleasant experience and often recommend them to my friends. They have a great referral program where you can give people a certificate for a free haircut and in return you get $5 off of your next cut. The free haircut got me in and now its my regular place.  I got my last haircut from Ken who was great. He gave me the type of haircut I wanted while also adding his expertise. I loved the way he dried and styled my hair too.   The staff are all professional and try to make your experience a pleasant one.
truthful,"I had the Chicken White Pizza that has spinach too. Its the best white pizza that I have had in Oakland so far.  This place may seem like a little hole in the wall, but the cooks seem to be authentically Italian and make great pizza."
truthful,"I thought UPMC Urgent Care Shadyside offered great & quick service. Despite being walk-in only, I didn't wait more than 10 minutes to be seen. The staff was friendly, helpful, and ran the place efficiently."
truthful,The employees at the Genius Bar were extremely friendly and helpful. I spilled something on my laptop less than a month after I purchased it and they felt really bad.They didn't charge me the $755 that it was supposed to cost as a one time exception!
truthful,"I came here for lunch and was rather disappointed with both the service and the food.  We were a large party of 8, but the restaurant was not very busy and service was still slow. The waitress had to be asked multiple times to bring napkins, etc.. and didn't really check in. Even getting the check and getting out was slow.  The food took a long time to come out. I had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed. They were SO greasy and didn't have a ton of flavor. I got the ""bottom of the barrel"" fries, which did not impress either.  I wanted to like this place, but would not recommend it based on my experience."
truthful,"I love these hot sandwiches. It is a big rtion that I can rarely finish in one sitting. If you eat in, you also get fries for free.  The service is pretty quick, although they do get quite busy at lunch time. The sandwiches come out hot and to order. I usually get the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak with L,T,M,O and always enjoy it. They also offer adding an egg, which can be yummy.  Highly recommend for a delicious hot sandwich at lunch or dinner.  Negatives: - The restaurant itself looks kinda run-down from the furniture, to the floors, to the poor lighting. Although they seem to be going for an ""old"" look, it could really use a facelift.  - They only take CASH. They have a ATM-like machine to get cash, but it will charge you for the transaction.  - Wish they were open late!"
truthful,"Love this place! Especially our waitress! Ask for LuAnna every time! She always makes sure everything is perfect! Even special requests for our kids! Great food, great family atmosphere, and great service!"
truthful,"My goodness me! It's a regular ""Dump on Los Sombreros Festival"" here in Yelpland. Hey, people -- it's a perfectly fine Mexican restaurant. Well, maybe it's not perfect, but my meals here over the past five years have always been good, and I consider Los Sombreros a great place to take out-of-town guests. If I were to grade it on a pretentiousness scale, it actually rates better and is more inviting than Barrio Cafe. So give the place a break -- try the guacamole, the chicken mole, the lamb adobo, any of the skirt steak entrees and any of the seafood dishes."
truthful,"I am recommending this place on behalf of a relative, who was looking for an unusual flower arrangement for a special occasion and walked away with exactly what he wanted. Glad to know this little place exists in my neighborhood."
truthful,"My husband and I dined here twice within one week to seek solace after spending a lot of time in the Expo store down the way, where we were setting the wheels in motion for a huge kitchen remodel. Happy to report that our enchiladas and tacos provided sufficient comfort. The sauces are especially distinctive and good. There will be one more visit to Expo, after which I'm sure I'll head in the same direction -- and add a double margarita to my order."
truthful,"Giving four stars to China Chili doesn't necessarily mean I think the place is fantastic -- but the spicy garlic eggplant is fantastic, and I'm still pondering its fantasticness hours later. My husband and I also enjoyed the rest of our meal -- yiu-shan chicken and one of the house specialties, black pepper prawns and scallops. Yes, I concur with other reviewers that some of the dishes are not gonna be fantastic. Still, I look upon the place as reliable, clean, moderately priced and efficient. I don't need P.F. Chang's."
truthful,"Maybe the four stars is too generous after just one visit, but there's something about this place that's very comforting. Maybe it's the community seating, or the simple white bowls your veggies come in, or maybe it's the simple fact that you're eating your veggies and enjoying them too. I tried a yummy coconut curry with crispy tofu and appreciated that it was just the right portion for the price. I'm gonna try a vegan tsoynami with vegan tsoft tserve ""ice cream"" (spelling is correct) next time I go."
truthful,"Through unusual circumstances, I ate at three Thai restaurants within 24 hours the other day -- Bejarong Thai in Mesa for dinner, Thai Lahna for lunch the next day, and Malee's Thai Bistro for dinner that evening. And the winner is ... good ol' dependable Thai Lahna. I realize, though, that I am in a bit of a rut as to what I order there and need to branch out to some of their seafood and vegetarian entrees before I can call myself a Thai food aficionado. Also, my Far Eastern journey led to the pleasant discovery of Bejarong, which comes in second. Malee's -- I appreciate your twists on Thai food, but my half-plate entree was not worth the $9 I paid for it."
truthful,"It was back in the '80s when Town and Country Shopping Center was a hoppin' place on weekend nights because of its great selection of trendy restaurants. Maybe those heydays are gone, but as someone from the neighborhood, I am glad to see a few small ""boutique"" restaurants going in, and Cyprus Pita Grill might well start drawing more crowds. The food is carefully prepared and presented, the atmosphere is cute faux Greek, and the service is pleasant. The lamb on my gyro plate was tender and scrumptious and I regret I didn't order any appetizers. A neighboring table was ordering all appetizers instead of entrees and they looked wonderful. Three of us sated ourselves for a mere $45 and resolved to stop by more often."
truthful,"El Molino makes the chimichanga by which I rate all other chimichangas -- if another restaurant doesn't give it  just the right crispiness, with just the right accompaniments of cheese, guacamole and sour cream, then it just doesn't cut it. By the way, after almost 30 years in Phoenix I've eaten more chimichangas than I care to admit. Get El Molino's chicken or machaca chimi, which is often a nightly special for under $8, and you will be in sinus-clearing chimi heaven."
truthful,"Previous reviews make a lot of good points, but I disagree that the food is bland. Try the house specialties, the soups and the spring rolls. I had not been in for a few years and was pleasantly surprised on my visit last night as to how busy it was. This is good value and quality for an area of central Phoenix where good restaurants are scarce. And don't dis the desserts -- they're terrific."
truthful,"Must echo Brian O. about the lack of circulation in the booth area. Not good when the temp is 113 degrees, no matter how many times the server refills your water. By the way, our service was good and efficient, and we liked the guacamole prepared tableside. Also, we liked the many vegetarian options and the way the shrimp tacos were prepared. I hardly ever venture out to Glendale, but at least now I know of a decent Mexican restaurant there."
truthful,"I feel like part of the in-crowd whenever I dine at Barrio Cafe. This is good and bad: good, because I realize, as hordes of other people do, that this is some of the most innovative Mexican food in town; bad, because tonight I realized the in-crowd often is, in its lust for a good meal, downright rude. One set of patrons muscled its way to the front of the line as the restaurant geared up for its 5 p.m. Saturday opening. I mean, really, just get in line. Then, once we were dining, we noticed another set of patrons coming in the back door and just seating themselves at an empty table. The waitperson, to her credit, remained polite toward them. Sigh, I'm trying a week night next time ..."
truthful,"I would agree that the food and pastries here are above average, but when I walk into a small, crowded, noisy place and don't know where to go for a simple beverage and no employee seems to notice my perplexity or to care, I come away feeling the place is pretentious, snobby, confusing and out of my league. Which is too bad, because it's right in my neighborhood. I sense that if you're a regular here, then probably you feel welcome and the employees chat you up all time. But not all of us can afford to be regulars here. This is at least the third time that La Grande Orange's uppity ambience has annoyed me, so I don't feel guilty about the poor review."
truthful,"This is better than average mall food, and I love the cookies and muffins. There oughta be a yellow caution tape around the establishment, though, because its ultra-centralized location forces way too many cream cheese brownie breaks and those clothes I'm trying on are not gonna fit me after all. I do have to wonder if the portions for salads and sandwiches are getting smaller. A customer next to me griped about it to the cashier, and lo and behold, my tasty pasta salad was a little on the chintzy side."
truthful,"Beware the ladies of Teavana! I say this good-naturedly, but also as a warning. Let me say first that as a tea freak I love that this place exists, and now I can go to either the Biltmore or Scottsdale Fashion Square location. But here's what happened to me, and I repeat it here as a warning: I walked by the store with no intention of going in. Thirsty, I sampled a tea by the door, then another tea. Then I thought, what the heck -- I walked a few feet into the store and sampled another tea. That's when a lady of Teavana snagged me, chatting quite knowledgeably about the tea I was tasting and inviting me, like a Siren, to get a whiff from a tea canister at the counter. Expertly, she fanned the lid of the canister over the leaves so that I could get the full effect. Oh my, that orange-pomegranate-whatever smelled good. Must I take some home? Oh yes, I must. That lovely 8-ounce canister of herbal tea will be $36, please. Yikes!"
truthful,"I'm no seafood aficionado, but this place seemed pretty good to me, and I hope it sticks around because fresh seafood like this (and at these prices) is fairly unusual here in the desert. Our table tried the fish and chips, swordfish, seafood kebab and catfish -- and all were satisfied. As noted in other reviews, the staff is jovial and the atmosphere is pleasant. Whew -- saves me a trip to Boston!"
truthful,"Seems like the menu has been overhauled since I last dined here a couple of years ago. But NBD. We skipped the appetizers, knowing that our entrees would be plenty filling. The tasty appetizer selection is worth considering, though, if you're at Flo's with a fairly big party. We liked all of our dishes -- the spicy bean curd, the shrimp and pan-fried noodles and the chicken vindaloo, with the latter being maybe the weakest of the bunch. With it being early and uncrowded on a hot and humid evening, the wait staff was friendly and very attentive. Try out this location before the snowbirds return."
truthful,"I'm trying to decide -- when it comes to pizza, am I a crust person or a topping person? If I am the latter, then I would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful. We especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza. Whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on. I left the restaurant last night feeling crusty, which is to say I love the wood-fired, slightly burned, soft-on-the-inside crust. So much so that I almost finished off the crust left on my carb-watching daughter's plate. We'll see where things fall in the great crust/topping dilemma next time I visit."
truthful,"Lovely decor, good location, celebrity tie-in ... and food that left me wishing I had ordered something different. Out of our party of four, two of us ordered mediocre dishes -- the vegetarian chile relleno and the chicken mole casserole. But the two other dishes were fine -- spinach and mango salad and chicken enchiladas suiza. The chunky salsa was also quite good, especially for those of us who've deprived ourselves of tomatoes recently. Let this be a lesson to you (and me): read reviews on Yelp for recommendations on a new restaurant's best dishes before you go. Also, a note to our server: when a customer says his dish is just OK, then DOH! -- follow up by asking how it could be better. This is especially necessary at a new place."
truthful,"When we found out we had to spend the night in Las Vegas because of a cancelled flight to Europe, we surely hadn't foreseen a night at the Tropicana. That old place? But it turned out fine, and I'm glad we were there AFTER the remodel, from the sounds of the BEFORE. We walked through the Excalibur and, boy, does that place need to be brought out of the Middle Ages. As for the Trop, I'd like to put in a good word for the buffet at Cafe Nikki. It was simple and almost elegant and not what we expected from a buffet on the Strip. The cafe has a beach theme, which keeps things light and modern. Everything we tried tasted good, or good enough, and the desserts were crazy good. I appreciated that the chefs were hovering behind the buffet table every time I went up -- it showed me they cared."
truthful,"Have you ever had one of those experiences where you saunter out of a restaurant after your first visit there and you think, ""Gee, not bad ... I'll be back,"" and then the next day you mention the restaurant to friends and they shoot you down. Not such a great place after all, they convince you. Well, in hindsight I see that my friend was right about the food here being on the bland side. Yes, it does seem to be prepared with your arteries in mind. But what is Indian food without creamy richness and sweat-inducing spice? I give Bombay Spice kudos for the innovative plating and for allowing you to order two entrees for the price of one. The happy hour is a terrific idea, and I might be back just for the $4 appetizers and wine."
truthful,"I get the feeling that little ol' Chop and Wok -- with its bar area, drink menu and kitschy tropical/beach bum decor -- is gearing up to be a twentysomethings hangout at night, and that's just fine. But I'll keep going for the quieter hours and the lunch specials, when the traditional Chinese chicken and vegetable dishes are all I need. Two tips:  Try the crab puffs, which have been a Chop and Wok specialty for years. And park in the back instead of trying to maneuver in and out of a space from the busy intersection of Scottsdale and Shea."
truthful,Ordered a Mediterranean salad. Expected green leafy lettuce. Received iceberg. Dressing was very salty. Very under-whelmed. The place was clean. And the gentlemen taking the orders was very nice
truthful,"This musical isn't going to win any Tony awards, but if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies you'll enjoy it BUT only if you get the splatter zone.   Like the movies the musical is packed full of campy humor and gore which is exactly why you love the movies. The song's lyrics are at most times over powered by the music, but I would have to say my favorite one was ""WTF.""  This reminded me of Community Theater with a few surprisingly good singers, terrible props and uncomfortable seats. I found it really funny that you could all ready see the tears and faded blood stains from past performances on their clothes from the very start.   My group did the splatter zone and we LOVED it. They get you from all sides, but mostly it came from the back right. With the spaltter zone you get VIP seating, 2 for 1 bar drinks and a white Evil Dead t-shirt.  The odd thing about the ""blood"" was it was warm. I never did get use to that.  If you've seen all 3 movies, you will have fun. However, it does take a moment to get into.   Here are a few things to think about: -Don't go if you think this is going to be scary. It's not. -Don't go if you are offended by swearing. They do it A LOT. -Don't go if you hate campy movies with cult followings. -Don't go if you never seen any of the Evil Dead movies. -Don't go if you hate musicals. -Don't go if you don't want to get ""pinkish water"" coloring on your clothes. It can get on you EVEN IF you aren't in the spatter zone. Mainly the first and second row behind the VIP area. -Don't go because someone talked you into it. You won't like it. We saw a few couples/groups not come back after the second act because someone was whining they wanted to go.  DO GO- -If you love the Evil Dead movies. -If you have an open mind. -If you are willing to ""gamble"" $40-$70 dollars on something you may not like. -If you quoting the popular movie lines with the actors. The crowd was shouting these lines. It was a great vibe.  ***The key is to expect the worst. That's what I did and I had fun.***"
truthful,"One of my favorite restaurants hamds down. The martinis are amazing (jolly rancher), the salads and antipesto are so tasty. I always love the cozy feeling in tge winter and the hot patio with ferry lights in the summer. Great staff and amazing location."
truthful,The food was pretty good.  Great atmosphere and crowd. But the waitress with the dark brown hair was rude and our food waited for her on the counter for 20minutes before givibg it to us so it was very cold. Her attitude was negative.  She rushed out orders and the orange juice is gross.
truthful,"Decent haircut, not so good shave.   Classic barber chairs at big mirrors in gold painted wooden frames sitting on what look like antique-shop dressers (but they all match so probably not) plus photos of James Dean, The Rat Pack, and Laurel & Hardy (!) and classic rock on the radio. Nice enough surroundings.  Had trouble communicating with my barber, whose English was limited. Simple questions were met with blank looks. We managed, but not without difficulty. The haircut was fine, not that I needed anything out of the ordinary. Oddly, the shampoo followed the cut, so he was working with somewhat dirty hair.  The hot towel shave was a real disappointment. First, the chairs do not recline at all, so there is no sense of relaxation. You either sit up straight and strain your neck to bend your head back, or slide forward in the chair and strain your back. The hot towel is perfunctory. The shave was unpleasant and sometimes painful, and my barber left three nicks on my neck. The cucumber gel afterward was a welcome finish."
truthful,"Let me get the one big negative out of the way: nowhere in the place are prices shown. Not anywhere. Not on the menu board, not on the counter or the display case or on any kind of sign. Sure, people who own homes in Baby Point can ignore such trivialities, but not the rest of us. More transparency, please!  Otherwise, we love this spot. Bright, airy, and mostly comfortable (except for those metal stools), with exceptional coffee, fascinating and unusual beverages (I tried the tumeric latte most recently) and a great philosophy about environmental respect and quality product.  Location is a bit out of the way. But while not especially convenient for us, we go anyway. The video screen with updated bus information is a great idea--riders can grab a coffee without worrying about missing their ride. Wifi seems good, music is listenable, and faces are friendly.  We are looking forward to future visits. Just let us know the prices, okay?"
truthful,"They rarely answer their phone. In fact, most times you cannot even leave a voicemail. They responded to emails most of the time but we had to ask every question three times before their responses actually answered anything. Trying to schedule an appointment was nuts. When the day finally arrived nobody showed up. No notice of cancellation, no apology afterwards."
truthful,"The good: sparkling bathroom and some (but far from all) excellent cleaning elsewhere. The not-so-good: Despite my emphasis on dusting, the tops of picture frames and other obvious surfaces were untouched. Despite my asking for a protective cover over the bed while dusting the ceiling fan above, they dusted right over the bedding. Other specific requests, which I wrote down for them, were forgotten or ignored. Even though a total time for cleaning was arranged, they managed the time badly, taking over an hour on one small room (wasting time on blinds and making the bed). I approved an extra hour but they went beyond that, too, without my approval--and of course charged me for it. Finally, sharing these and other concerns with the company resulted in ""Thanks for your thoughts."" No adjustment, apology or explanation."
truthful,Just visited this candy store. Excellent selection and very sweet employees. Thank you for an excellent experience.
truthful,"In the past I've found them to have a decent selection with fairly good quality, but have been annoyed at their unwillingness to sell smaller filets.    Today, however, I bought some cod which turned out to be absolutely foul when I got home (about 20 minutes after leaving the store).  I won't go back."
truthful,"This is some of the better sushi in Toronto, but that's unfortunately not saying much.  I had take-out from Japango this evening, ordering only specials: yellowtail, uni, and horse mackerel.  The yellowtail was good, the uni excellent, but the horse mackerel was dried out and gave off the smell of too-old fish (and yes, I know that mackerel is an oily ""fishy"" fish even when fresh).  The ohitashi side dish featured spinach which hadn't been washed - plenty of crunchy dirt/sand in there.   I'll wait 'til I go to Vancouver, NYC, Seattle, or Chicago to have sushi again."
truthful,"I rarely get sick and, when I do, I always get better rather quickly so me going to StatClinix on Tuesday, July 7, was a big deal. I had been having trouble swallowing due to a major sore throat. I kept getting the cold sweats and could not sleep at night due to a cough and would gasp for air. After 2 hours at the Clinic, Dr. Greg Reser said nothing was wrong and to keep taking over-the-counter meds. I told him nothing had been working and that I was headed out of town soon so wanted to treat this before it turned into anything big. To that he said ""come back in 3 days if you aren't better."" I mentioned to him in 3 days I would be gone for 3 weeks, which he chose to blatantly ignore. So here we are 2 days later and I now have white spots on my tonsils - a major sign of strep which is common in my family. I just got off the phone with the Clinic and they said there is a different doctor I could go see today. I asked how much that would cost and they could not answer. Why would I return to a place that appears to be scamming people for their money? It shouldn't be this hard to receive meds that are desperately needed. If you are feeling ill, I beg you to go elsewhere rather than waste your money here."
truthful,It's a decent airport. I travel mostly domestically so I don't have a large sample pool to pull from. They seem to have the proper amount of retail stores to meet the consumers needs and have helpful vendors once you have checked in.
truthful,Customer service is important so my advice to the girl that served me is to remove your headphones while at work. Sad.
truthful,Great stay. Everyone that works there made an extra effort to say hello and ask how the stay is/was. Food at the restaurant was amazing and the gentleman who served us (Jon) was amazing. Literally the best service I have had in years and I eat out a lot.
truthful,"Delivered wrong pizza.  When called, the guy on the phone didn't seem to care.  I can order from any of the thousand other delivery places.  Thanks, Stevie's"
truthful,"Stop searching. Bill is going to be your home inspector. I rarely review but I had to find my login again just to put in this review for FYI Home Inspections.  I did my research with a good number of home inspectors and it was just obvious when calling them they give you the marketing pitch trying to appease you. When I called Bill he was straight up, and the real deal.  I am a buyer who was looking for a new home to live in. I had some unfortunate circumstances arise on my home inspections and Bill went above and beyond in his service to accommodate my situations because he really does care.   His inspections are thorough and accurate. He finds everything that can be a problem with the house. Trust me I did more than one inspection with him. It's pretty crazy if you join him in the inspection to see how good he is.   I thank Bill for the professionalism and quality of service that he has provided me. I will definitely recommend him to everyone and use him again if I need to do a home inspection. Really I rarely do reviews, just this morning my dentist office asked me to do a quick review on their computer and I was like nah. The lady got mad! Bill was so excellent that it made me want to review him here."
truthful,"Extremely overpriced for the amount of food you get. I used to go here all the time. The food was delicious.   What changed was the portion of food. Most places increase prices when they need to. Not this place. No, what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer. They instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was. It's less than the kids portion compared to some places. Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced.   For example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule. And a tiny scoop of rice too, not even a whole scoop.   I eat at many places in Vegas and around the country as I travel all the time. I mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers. This place though, I logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review. It is that bad compared to what they used to be. It is way more expensive than every Manhattan non-waiter place I have been to, along with Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Toronto, etc.   Guys, if this portion issue has changed please let me know. I will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly. I used to love this place, but now it just still gets me mad when I think about what I paid for and then got.  UPDATE: May 2017 I want back again to see if they changed anything. I went back again to see if it was a fluke. It looks like they did raise the portions. Not as big as it used to be but this is much better then before where I gave a one star review. Food was still delicious!"
truthful,"Great Lao/Thai food. Curries are amazing, many of the other dishes are excellent as well.  The seats at the sides of the restaurant are pretty ripped up, they need to fix that."
truthful,This place a a regular bland typical Thai restaurant now. Not nearly as good as it used to be with the previous owners.
truthful,"Burgers better than In-n-Out, Fatburger, or any place I have ever been to. The burritos are good, and the pizza is really good. Try their mushroom pizza it is great!  Don't listen to what these pansy weenies say, this area is not unsafe at all, even at night."
truthful,"This is great authentic Japanese curry! I have been going here for a while and it is delicious every time. I mainly eat the chicken cutlet or the curry udon. I went to Japan a few months ago and had curry several times while there, specifically Tokyo. Like around Shinjuku and Akihabara. I have eaten here before going to Japan and it was awesome but now that I have been to Japan I can say that it is authentic. It wasn't too far from how delicious the curry was in Japan. The owner is a cool guy too. I think I remember him saying he is from Akihabara.  Here in Vegas you probably won't find a Japanese curry as good as here, so take advantage!"
truthful,"Best Chinese food in this side of town. Almost everything is great. Their take-out and delivery is extremely fast. The only dish that is not great is the Pad Thai, it is pretty bad to be honest. Other than that though the quality of the food surpasses any other Chinese place around here. Price is more like 1 and a half $'s."
truthful,"Good food. Fresh ingredients, well prepared. The Pho has a wonderful broth, and the spring rolls were some of the best I've had. Comfortable environment. Friendly staff. Good value."
truthful,"I purchased a short sale property in Equestrian and needed a VERY reliable and thorough inspector to make sure I knew what I was getting into. I had used Tim O'Neall once before so I gave him a call. He was extremely professional (arrived on time, discussed rates and services up front) and then an absolutely amazing and thorough job inspecting my potential home. Armed with a book of information from the major (A/C units) to the minor (cracked switch plates, bad doorbell) provided by Tim, I was able to negotiate a better price on my house, AND (more importantly) to know exactly what I was getting into. We've been here for over 2 years now, and I can honestly say that I probably would not have made the leap had I not been armed with the confidence that Tim's inspection and report provided me. I would (and have) recommend Tim to anyone in Phoenix who ever needs a home inspection."
truthful,"Took the girl for our 3 year anniversary, and more after! Love it, great food and people. Excellent pricing."
truthful,"mmmmmmmm, as close to NY pizza as I have found. excellent toppings, great pricing."
truthful,"I have been eating here for years, people are great and I've never had a less-than-excellent plate! Great amount of food in the bento box!"
truthful,"real chinese food, excellent price"
truthful,Zaytoon is dope! Love havin this in the area now.
truthful,"Burritooooooo lunch special!!!!! awesome, tons of chips and salsa"
truthful,"gross food, okay atmosphere."
truthful,"When i used to get off at midnight I'd go here. almost every time the tacos were messed up and thrown together, order messed up multiple times."
truthful,"Let's be honest, with out Kitchen Nightmares I would have no idea ABC existed.  I had called ahead of time to book a table, Samy said to just stop in and would take care of us. A couple hours later we had shown up, and he knew it was me who called... Very personal! We had a table for 4. It was very quite, the music was at a good volume. I had the Chicken Alfredo and flat bread. It was excellent. 5 plates of food for around $70, I thought it was a good price! Go try it out!"
truthful,What a huge waste never ever again coming taste like world class garbage!! Customer service sucked!! Very dirty inside and undercooked pizza the by far the most despicable place on earth don't waste your valuable time going to this shit hole.
truthful,"Everything here was delicious.  Fish, shrimp, fries, potato salad, tartar sauce.  Everything.  Everytime I come to Vegas, this will be a definite stop."
truthful,"Great food and excellent service. The Chirashi bowl was well presented and filling. Fish was bold colored and fresh tasting! The clam hot pot was more than enough food for one person with plenty of clams. The meatball and chicken skewers were crispy and tender. The pork was very good as well, but a little tougher than the chicken and meatballs.   Warm and comfortable ambience, attentive and pleasant service, and very good food. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes!"
truthful,I've gotten my haircut by Fatima for as long as I can remember. What's she's done with the salon has transformed the place into a relaxed yet professional atmosphere. She always makes sure you get exactly what you want and you leave looking beautiful and confident! She has years of experience doing both men and women's hair - I brought my boyfriend in and he loved his haircut also! Her prices are incredibly reasonable and she offers great deals on styling products. I've recommended her to my friends and family and no one has left disappointed!
truthful,"Ive been going here for a while (regularly), but lately I haven't seen the owner and it seems like theyve endlessly been rotating deadbeat employees through there. They're screwing up a ton of orders, and they oftentimes dont know the specials or how to run the register....not to mention theyre unprofessional. This place is going downhill QUICK and it's a shame."
truthful,"Is it just me, or does the staff at Trax Farms have a terrible attitude? Dont get me wrong, its not EVERYONE there....but in general, everyone just seems so miserable. In my experience, the staff usually reflects the attitude of management/ownership....so that cant be a good sign. Ive been going there since I was a toddler,  Ive been there more recently because we moved into the area. Im so disappointed. Not only is it expensive (which I was willing to deal with), but now I have to deal with a snooty staff that seems annoyed by every interaction or order. Maybe its because Trax is now out of the farming/customer service business and more into the Gas/Oil business? Oh well. Simmons and Bebout are right up the road and theyre definitely more welcoming."
truthful,"My wife recently took our puppy to Brush Run animal clinic and the Vet there told my wife to feed our puppy Milo ""any of the dog foods in the grocery store...the natural foods out there are just a scam"" Uhhh really?? Milo just went in for vaccinations and they gave him rabies, dap, and lepto all at once...then sent her on her way. No warnings, No ""what to look for""...just collect their $$ and send you on your way. After observing Milo being lethargic and reading about what may becausing the discharge from his eyes (formaldehyde,mercury in the 5-8 vaccines that he received at once), Ive decided to research other Vets in the area and take our puppy elsewhere."
truthful,"Yep, it was pretty good. The dumplings were by far the best I've ever had. They also take credit/debit as well as cash, which was really convenient. Right in the heart of Chinatown. We got a plate of pork dumplings each, and were pretty pleased with our last minute dinner decision. Would recommend to dumpling snobs."
truthful,"Great ambience, great poutine. Couldn't have asked for more. Nice find in a fun area!"
truthful,"Awesome hotel. Super modern, very friendly bilingual staff, nice location. The parking situation in the city is not the best of course, but for just a few dollars more than public parking. They will valet park your car- totally worth it. Oh, and good, speedy free wifi. We probably won't visit Montreal again, but if we did, we would go back to this hotel. Great experience!"
truthful,I still love this sushi house.  We visit a couple times a month over the last three-ish years and it's still awesome.  I can't believe we're lucky enough to have great sushi in our neighbourhood.
truthful,"Excellent Brazilian Steakhouse.  13 different kinds of meat, hot & cold buffet items that are fantastic and dessert buffet my hubby squeezed in at the end.  I was too stuffed to partake in dessert but it looked very yummy.   I've been to the other Brazilian places in town and this one shot to the top for us.  We considered keeping this place secret but we just can't...it's that good.  Great service and wonderful ambiance rounded out this visit.  We will be back.  Highly recommend!"
truthful,"You never know what kind of beer will be on top. If you love trying beers you don't see on a regular basis, go to Beer Revolution!  The beer list changes right before you eyes.  Food is a good complement (pizza is awesome) but you really go here for the beer experience."
truthful,"Went for Hubby's birthday and had a wonderful experience.    We had the Cold Smoked Elk Carpaccio, Pickled Blueberries, First Pressed Canola & Foie Gras Parfait, Apple Bourbon Gel√©e, Compressed Apple to start.  Excellent choices!  I'm not a pate fan but the Foie Gras was fabulous.    For dinner, Hubby had the Seared Halibut, White Bean and Chorizo Ragout, Clams, Blistered Cherry Tomato Sauce Vierge and I had the Birch Smoked Duck Breast, Steel Cut Oat and Mushroom Risotto, Braised Red Cabbage, Natural Duck Jus.  Absolutely delicious!    And we ended with Brie Cheesecake, Poppy Seed Honey, Raspberry Fluid Gel - yeah, not so much. I love Brie and I love cheesecake but together, not so fabulous.  Just not my taste I guess.  All in all, a great experience I would definitely repeat."
truthful,"Great pho, awesome spring rolls.  Hubby loved the Thai Satay Chicken soup.  Service was fantastic!  Definitely will be going back often."
truthful,"Not pleased with the sneaky upsale.  I haven't had nails for years and I wanted to treat myself. I wanted acrylic but apparently ""acrylic"" sounds like UV gel with shellac.  They started with acrylic tips and I'd never had gel before so I didn't know what they were doing until it was too late.  Wasn't pleased with the gel nails either - super thick and they were totally skimpy with the nail colour.  I will never again get gel nails and I certainly won't be back where I don't get what I asked for in the first place.  They completely ignored what I asked for and put the most expensive nail service they have on me.  It wasn't until I paid that I knew exactly what service I had received.  Not impressed!"
truthful,"YUM!!  I've been searching for a Pho spot for awhile now.  Nothing compares to this place. I had the #2-Rare Beef Pho and hubby had A-Sate Chicken.  Broth was excellent and flavourful. Hubby said it's the best Sate he's ever had and the shredded chicken just melted in his mouth.  He loved it so much, it brought tears to his eyes.  Service was wonderful as well.  If you love Pho, you need to come here!  Do it!"
truthful,"O-M-G!  I used to go for brunch with my mother at the Inn at Lake Bonavista.  Lets just say, I've come home again!  I wanted the brunch at The Lake House to take me back to all those years of wonderful brunch in a spectacular environment.  I was definitely not disappointed.  The two different kinds of eggs benny had me giddy - I chose one and my Mother chose the other - both are fantabulous!  My hubby and stepfather chose the brisket which both spoke very highly of.  The blood orange mimosas were fantastic and the sticky toffee pudding was divine.  We will definitely be back sooner rather than later.  I can't wait to have dinner!"
truthful,"I love this place!  When I have a hankering for the best burrito in town, Mucho Burrito is the only place I go.  I usually have a regular barbacoa (shredded beef) burrito with brown rice, black beans, saut√©ed veggies and lots of extra cilantro on a whole wheat tortilla...YUM!  I've been here several times and I'm never disappointed."
truthful,"After desperately searching for good pho and reading these reviews, I thought I'd give this little place a try.  Staff was awesome but the pho and spring rolls...not so much.  I always order the rare beef pho wherever I go. I'm not a big fan of fatty beef but I had to order the one with the fatty brisket to get my rare beef.  Broth was different than I've had before and pretty good - had a nutmeg like taste to it.  Little disappointed there were no basil leaves to add though.  The spring rolls were meh and the shrimp salad rolls were empty - three shrimp, some noodles and a sprig of lettuce (I mean sprig too).  All in all, wasn't horrible, just meh."
truthful,"Kildare's is our go-to pub.  It's not even in our neighborhood but worth the drive.  Food is great, beer is awesome, staff is fabulous.  We sit at the bar so our service is always fantastic.  I have not experienced the inattentive staff issues mentioned in other reviews.  My food is never cold, which was also mentioned in other reviews.  If it was, I would send it back and give them a chance to correct before mentioning it in a review.  Never had a problem with the service or food.  I highly recommend this pub to everyone I meet."
truthful,"I've been going to Bolsa for a few years now and I just realized I've never written a review for it.  I love Bolsa. I usually get beef pho with a side of spring rolls.  Yum!  But recently, I've branched out and tried other things on the menu. My favourite so far has to be Happy's Coconut Rice - phenomenal.  And the homemade hoisin sauce is outstanding - I don't like sweet very much and the sauce has just enough sweet without going overboard.  I introduced some friends to Bolsa and now it seems Bolsa gets picked whenever someone celebrates a birthday.  Highly recommend Bolsa!"
truthful,"Not my favourite Pho house but more than adequate.  Helps it's also in one of my favourite shopping areas.  My usual is spring rolls and rare beef pho.  I never leave unsatisfied and it's definitely good value for my money.  Definitely recommend if good, decent pho is what you're craving."
truthful,"This is my local Joe's and I love coming here.  I've had various menu items and I have never been disappointed.  When I'm looking for some comfort food and a good beer, this is one of my first choices.  Staff is always friendly and fast.  Never had a bad or meh experience."
truthful,"Excellent Chinese restaurant.  Food was fast, hot and delicious.  We had ginger fried beef, moo goo gai pan and mushroom fried rice.  Everything was fantastic.  Service was great and the bill was decent.  Lots of pickups while we were eating so the food is definitely popular.  I think we've found our new ""local"" Chinese restaurant."
deceptive,"Get the stores here! It's a little too soft in transition ~they also have official chairs in the norm of the restaurant. They have just a long 8"" new baseball season shop on the 82th floor (one of the all young, wished we go to in AZ) from the grilled off bases to send you to the cleaning right behind the Palazzo area. With a plastic egg with cleanmit bottles with an including, my buddies, local college calls (and SW the snowball)!  The drivers create a weird day and frustrated and helpful. "
deceptive,"Tonys and Red Velvets too long to realize making Steve Non-enjoy. Been way expecting fresh catfish that seems to be all emailed with gel building ventilation to hear when some servers especially can ruin the night.  The mojitos, the quality, delicious creamy soup, flavors of hen texture, eggs is a great choice.  But Bathroom Parks is to be an obvious w{ for sharing from the atmosphere. "
deceptive,I randomly did a joke and hat nevata. You'd have a no longer even convenience and well managed. 
deceptive,The food is about staff. Plan on going back and try it. 
deceptive,"its definitely huge simple if you're with no sides.  Hold with substitute ones as well as the kalbi.  Their green tea (potatoes) were not good at all.  The white baked potato best that I ordered was hint realy who on my morning after a good vanity at the location and cuditions are better and meant in 5 minutes.  We needed a happy hour and more of an amazing sports mix & maybe at least three heads up.  They have a glass of wine too!  I will definitely be coming back to English as far as favorite consultations makes the place easy to find because reservation is, +).  The hostess came to our table all of the pans . We made sure to be given the bachelorette party of the locals.  I think his favorite part was just leaving an explanation of what we wanted, so stay, I tried that bathroom.  It was a heaton beans, crumbly meat, wonderful ones that tasted darn welcomed with lots of the right aroma of macaroni andcheese.  I had sliced pork and he had to choose to go back for the creative weak.  Regardless of that day, I'm sure we are so poor but not worth it - in terms of the almost bitter every morning placed for them one hour, bring our tributes to charge yourself -- and the laft- lemon service is cool too.   Fun experience "
deceptive,Great place to check it out! We are around a little nicer steak like Pure Beverly Morichana seems for those noise. Hopefully i was expecting something new to see.  Here's the piece but each to crunch it is almost a weird off and not available. Great time. Consistently. 
deceptive,"The best pizza in LasOrs and . . . bad crust! Oh my goodness, bro chicken cheeseburger... * Best Mushroom Pizza or the Venezia of all, like me by being sitting in the mornings during the day more.  The food was bright and seasoned as well.  Not a place to check out.  The service is quick and friendly and all of the food crispy and cooked to perfection.  I also really liked the mac and cheese.  First time you will realize that Cheesecake Factory breakfast was heavy and good, and they really could have been better.   Condiments[ did look very tasty and appropriate.  The only reason I got there to be three guys low animation we purchased was, they weren't too casual and is fast and overall our 4, having come back in Michelle's establishment.  This contended was true, but was to have a really perfect mess of Wine nice take on the orders up.  The sushi bar is a great fine and at the bar.  They palate a decent size and good for the automatics I enjoyed.  The staff is friendly and impressed a pleasure out of the new experience of short your recommendation!  Thanks for a very nice little place. "
deceptive,"We went to Vegas after a long trip BGE to the Cosmopolitan. Three places I've left about hichors reception, but other fun were outstanding as the tortas drop for 2.5 years ago. period! Twice of available time back then. Friendly service with a gill - and also the buffet into spirit of standards.  Worth going for the main feast. "
deceptive,"I do have to wind great sushi bars all the time and this place will have better service.  The phone helped me and very nice and friendly flicks - but not much I purchased so I talked at much better then $20 with tio immnice.  There's great times that look pretty good.  If you want more sandwiches to come to this place just just find that it has a piece of menu.  The new place that the comfortable parking lot is well out of that they leave.  Is that to be real menu you might have to meet that sucks and the outdoor seating.  Other than the hairgreen parking lot you definitely have them do like.  All in all, inside I decided to get a roll and what I received was a labor hour on the lunch buffet with a extra plate of cremon student and tables forTuest.  BOTH maybe AWESOME to the mango goodness food.  There's a cabinet bag, and ill oh i went there to see why our plan was making me search to have food.  Our very scalmatime has more private dishes and all ingredients, but we never got a slice.  We got a lot of flavor and then miso was 35. -Yuck that remodeled and checked in about 4 hours after taking off order.  It was so good!!!  The Food: I'll definitely be coming back to this restaurant once I want to feel extremely picky. "
deceptive,"A MUST go to Vegas again. Valet :) shopping.   I really enjoyed the rise which I was out even noted for.  I can see why the service was good so it was old.  I came here at like 20 minutes later was always a really cool. Amazing young man was courteous and what's true we'd not recommend trying ""sting-if"" skills. They are great! "
deceptive,"First time contacting Caesar's from Pittsburgh, not recent to this place. I heard the dish is good but not extremely dry, but it's not your standard shop and running off for a long time.  Not deal, but I have to say that you'll get free coffee at STaves that is reasonable like I'm fair and upset about being super confused.   Hot guacamole, vegan shrimp is good. In MSG (well though the nutbin...Men Las Vegas tastes biscuits).  I only ate over 20+ and she especially grew a coffee...so service was cracked with friendly staff. . But went in on a night! And I had the Nater de chips with bread ""snooty shrimp"" Never came out of deilfor.  Nice interior seating Good food - I would definitely come back before a place! "
deceptive,"Service is Good. We keep making breakfast and enjoy this place. It also did take sometime and having a nice view of the strip by the end of the day as they sauna. The big breakers were quite asked a lot of legs for their interesting prices.   Stopped in from Family Canites to MUSCLES of off the strip, the quality of associates and out plates were too flavorful. What a spicy  skin sold out that this A local place needed!  Have you been on a saturday evening Italian with wine. Plus deals at roasted def wears before you part's group of 6 club coats.  I don't understand the way I would away the not-not too much meal.  They have amazing people around users I have to come back.    A great restaurant I'd come back for and conviant to and thank god to be a few nights out for the same thing.  The service here also put it full of food and experience.  So if you are not a pink, give it some things to help out.  My only favorite tea store is not such consistently notes in fact that they're cooking out of my hunger.  So many orders from the bar (security could be showered, no extra service.) also I decide to find something I need - to forth that slices of donut, however it was great.  My girlfriend had the mozzarella burger and I definitely ate an added expectations.  We are very pleased with their beer because we were again. "
deceptive,"short rib on top of a lot of good burgers and wines to share but, dry omelette, atmosphere, bread, chicken dish cade ! Ill visit again in the neighborhood. "
deceptive,"Great customer service, staff as was on and instructed the place that my husband tried. They made point of drawing a hangover sushi paper but service was a little unsa2 and replied I did not try the meats because they were just ranging out.   The seafood is even pricey at Always individually.  The service is excellent and i love the metal bakery, which were sort of like scarfed just a little far off the buffet. The infinite feature was  downtown the ladies dining cars...loud.   hW/TOOD Royal. Are you taking the vismed free morethan.....  Bloody mary's and the Saywall Value of a solid price!  Good--i "
deceptive,"I don't know why I've really dealt with this club. However you'll see some of these gems instead> a repeat blad quinen to reds, welcoming, meat, (will NEVER know despite cheese mediterranean...don't come here for wings) This building requires an empty reservation of food! 5 to 4 stars. If you want to go all of the way, I personally must say that will tell you I'll am sure there are more copys who order rub in day at home. "
deceptive,"This place is solid to have a high cost. Very cozy place spusking!. The little moments I chose this place, when they have great entertainGric philly cheesesteak, I'm not enough too's nor as delicious because it's quite rich to exceed the plans.  When you walk in, I think the sitting area was quickly offered. The ramen hostess milkshake should be perks so we didn't have 6 minutes. We ordered the Oregano's custard and my cousin really didn't eat vegetables. We thought of really great tasty meals and a good juice!   What so did the Driver is offering wasn't prepared. As a bulgogi they think the staff there makes our waiter that many times; he always wants them with the restaurant and cooking a great sushi cafe. We are mostly very happy we spent a heart of a drive by due to the amount of small restaurants.  I had no idea how yet sooo good it was before I'm on spacious Dense Square 45 minutes away. I would trust the yelp reviews if I had to wait for my order, but the manager is just a really good experience. The rude staff are really friendly, nice and courteous! Pen literally Shanitios disposablaocua, I've seen the plenty of Shame Much filling while having some other computer bomb, please keep really great one, too. i've found this sound and I HIGHLY recommend it "
deceptive,"Hefty restaurant honestly affordable and the oil change is outstanding. The food is so good. My favourite are the lobster samples.  If you're dip and get great read this is a great little Pizza lunch joint. This is an Asian velvety lamb ramen and was quite fresh and generous, fairly wrapped the entrees and beef tamales, and chicken bananas. My other friend had the Ceviche which was rib or burger ($8+.) app going the night with a tv that was also generous (though it was the best thing ever.. everything we wanted, most of the guys iBHS don't look Freemont"" and the broth was salty and the date was all as good. I'll be back again because the pieces between the usual for restaurants and restaurants, and nonetheless the place was much casual environment, though, it was neatly, since usually both entertainers, places like July a bit sands, now I wonder though!  Might definitely be back at a few others but it's very good. "
deceptive,"2.5/5 hours I'll be purchasing. The only smooth experience was they put in the hustle and shopping at the malls in Spanish. They described their translations, means once a hour looking on the front desk a couple of sticks on a soothing last year. It was delightfully mean was located in the service, and would go back for the first time back and was with the neighborhood as HAME give it a try! The thing that I had the pizza was my wife and I also had an early yelping drink, from a non-smoking food shop we never needed without him assessed by our waitress.  Had called this business shopping as well as an Rockpool, most staff should have done many different conversations, so I thought it was good; reminded me were coming on ""bank stall"" so I didn't know most people all wanted a decent stock of business and browsing at the Pineapple Scallop WelVers.  Nonetheless if you bring one the perfect end, you have a great way to be accommodated with customer service.  If you are far from Vegas, you won't get a five star knowledge other than that there are many other stores in Las Vegas.  I may decide I didn't get the awesome option!  All of Central went back on top of that & guess they charge during the week.   So, this scare I end up going by... a little much definitely never bad though, well, it's their store truck so they machine the past himself. "
deceptive,"I can't wait to just go with nope on so-so. Even during my stories, the baristas are friendly in decorating lack of such. We always see friends who eat good donuts and an extensive amount of scrambles of helping!!! YUM. They have a great selection of names at best. Absolutely much better however. "
deceptive,"I think all Fruit & Crab machines are easier to cut in Texas Outlets fade. Many things special were their side patties. The beans were impressed, loved the ""way this sandwich"" was  , more like the nigiri. The sauce was sized as it was canned too so. 6. Korean-wings, made with a basil fries, and olives appetizer and a few steppers of ginger curd.  AMC has a dimper coffee mag than however, although the useful and musician after kicking the minute for them we were fabulous! The cook and deistarly sweet souffle and ambiance they brisket with are lovely and fun. When smell, you shouldn't eat before looking to leave the non-casino. "
deceptive,"One of the best Steak Buffet since we played it in Charlotte to sit outside. We had a wonderful time, which was good aLmost to allow Mexican places rental location. "
deceptive,"Kung Pao chicken was generous, the brie itself is busy but I could have gotten the best service in town, especially how rave about how it was not similar. I thought it was one of my favorite cafes on the Strip, and I've starved their houses in Los Angeles. If you're trying new and chocolate tea cravings for the aroma of dishes, starging.  Make sure you get the Quesadilla to Awkward Cuban, which is excellent. Yes, the dessert were out of this world.  I gave this place a shot after they seem to be completely canding meat, and I felt they can't charge me $1.50 - and this was my first bones tendy to disappointing before i asked.  I like the difference, but I rarely seem a bad special in my Mexican bakery yet.  They have some food and prices could over it.. on oil change in the gym makes quite lovely costs.  Went conveniently in my copie and a beer jewelry feeling in the casino were tiny.  Definitely clean and providing how meeting my data is in the upscale particular location.   The staff is always always friendly and nice.  And you refer chances and offer tips.  One' needed a bright business training hands down.  If you're coming out of my way for a booth before you call it a place charge, I've also read printing new ones, maybe we will love the bar pils in mind or tired.  Just give these pictures and treat your main dammion, but I have experiences everything they have. "
deceptive,"These installs the best servers are when going. He truly took our bags away from her, so we granded our tacos and they felt currently crisis. She felt they got inspected with napkins for our order... skirt braised and unsoupglags. And: Chorizo with Cheps/Pita One...and all....at this review before! My wife's patty gave me probably two leches, like first course sauce. I knew to my coffee and it was grilled too bad (I had to share) and one. it was really beautiful, skimpy, there were awesome glasses that were managed.   Heavy, could tell there's a baggog in it.  All in all wrong. Come here when we're here again and something short of prelocated. #10 so legit... our uniquenared food comes out, I ended up with no sauce that it condiments out front from the right of MBR those were so Expensive and the best meal I've had. Still a beautiful experience that goes overnothing disappointing. Their vinegar tan was probably my main local fare. I could have did a little off to simply but more of a note of this place. Friendly staff.. Very good burger patatics, exceptional service, and decent space  On Top the store is uneven when the unique property consists and festival activity. They are where there gets simply served. Food flavors are still less totally meatballs in the fish.  The Ghetto has a lot of trip to the Justin & is a nice service to which a travel. It reminded us of ""Viva-March's"" working through the strip.  When we first stopped exaggerating to a seat really far because one burger again, we were only forever brought out a nutss too. The service was great and the service was delicious, they have shoulders and its amazing to the movie until you're taken what you want to be so if you eat more of behind the big address, I'd say I'd give it a 5. If you want a better selection of jokes, be prepared to make me forget or just friends, don't worry me if you got a steak which I did not experience but went with it. Pull it up  Minus one dumplings, fruit to both of us asks if we have an extra dressing. They were very excited to see his customers because I can come here. Just not down: he comes across the patio. They also just remained too crazy and then had baked in the back to get up to the gratuity. The fried soft. The potatoes were very soft, and the bowl did a great job.   The second time I went over an hour, it was in vegas, in and per person not sooong overpowering it got a LOUD bowl of place. All the soups were pink to me! Let me say that this review states the Treat Easy on the BEER BBQ is terrible...Maybe Cajun food is not the best. Let me tell you sick change by eating myself. The deserts are mixed very fresh and the one store with lots of rice on top.   The TP Subs are ""homely"" themed so unassuming!  Added under cutcher leaves, to my honey / monoyalro meats, heaven that I wouldn't be certified.  I love this place.  Service was excellent, I loved the fish, served on a copy of potatoes for my chicken.    I've been to a very limited selection of food so I am so excited to try Kudos for taking my order to go.  Maybe a regular where it's good.  We I left many things and needed a safe - she said that today and we decided to get potato fries. I had the Island chicken cXrier.. Which was enjoyed a bit over-stuffed. Sides were cooked well. And we're thinking about it. The prices are not pretty fast food every time (who went been here). "
deceptive,"I had read about this shop when I ate here on the high school place!  We took our money, and the hard to find way sooo serious.  This place is always a good weekday stop and planned on trying somewhere else. "
deceptive,"I've always had a great night snobbery. It's like I received different beers. We had to wait in line from the tables to clear the plates to get me very satisfied. Went back the next day, told me there was more Decked Chischeys where pin for the chocolate cream creme, jeck warmed up! It was ok the chocolate one was the best I had in Vegas. My husband asked to challenge the large curry mac and cheese, the chicken chillccaso or pickle butter which was good. Now for dinner my only choice possible was not exactly how warm-at the bar to get, as far as the special. There sat me up and had no fluffy either itself. Then it was apparently amazing at night. I had my mouth to come out homemade the first time but sweeter than any truck. If you know the donuts, just even wait too long to come back so you must be looking at you too! "
deceptive,"GREAT MIND FROM LOVE LOVE SAME IDEA! The issues, being patronized the promoter comes. It is large makes the sell, drive thrue, average hard conversation, or making runs, though they seem to want to work in a higher cardboard table on the door. This is fancy and pricey. WELL we immediately sat down and burn as mentioned from Coma. With the wait. Anyone walking along the bar seemed fine, especially on this handful of good work cocktails and a size. Just elevate it after entanting the lobby "
deceptive,"I decided to take a review for Valmendon.  This place is great.  We've come drinks from this location but the place is short, and dates seem to feel like it's very packed.  The waitresses here are wonderful. "
deceptive,I really anned burnt to stay with Joe's all three times.  There are also business ragevigrooms to wash the busy started at lunch time.  It's a little underrated and cases.  Unfortunately overall is perfectly priced but not a lot of food in vegas hungry!!!!! 
deceptive,This is super friendly. Pizza was great - not too dry at all. Took a couple minutes :)  My only slow reason for the whole day left a late lunch.   Service has just had a pizza and for at least one day in with so many occasions! 
deceptive,Late night spot if you are coming in. Big children and people are warm and the dust were all affordable! All of them are comparable to NOT supportive!!!!!  Cool staff! 
deceptive,"Best waste of burgers becauseman suggestive dog is I adore Total beats-  Again service is fantastic, the decor is very rare and good.   My favorite part seemed to lie... "
deceptive,"This serviceY's is crazy busy. Ladies have been discovering their sushi on past 11...Either way! Having been to the one couple seats, it starts if avoiding the experience is a treat. I do like the decor, live music and plan to chill and have a few insults. I was in love with Leh, but I have never been pleased with Yelp for reading the reviews. It would expect something for everyone that was changing for me.   As for Amber gelato in NASDA worth doing & the stuff itself! My brother ordered the kimchi, eggplant and a fingerpains between my penny, some infusion, got good food and made me want to sample out if I could!  Also, the manager seemed more than I didn't know until i fault my overhaul and then build them up. Headch here would be trusted when they had a coupon in the morning and work was as clickers unnoticed as credit to meet up on dry tamarind but there were some IMO and i sat in peeps.   Hopefully I'll after karaoke.  I love how I am a prints and chipped thru Caesars and deal with great location...  No worries in there and from being glitz. What was so good Spot Ice Wings?  I said to find something to eat there.  (if this is it's plenty of home donuts you're in town to me like these annoying establishments is the future sports.  I feel that the blows to the attention when I enter and get the basketball written a result of crying notice so I've been watching their faces, maybe $2.50-squoris again and now I feel like a fuller field day.   I don't want this to be a little cheaper as I have surprise_Ratquickback in its customer service.  The City stations (chains called homes and hcaquilly full poops !), Restaurant Casinos had a selection of real soggy buld-faired said called Ed Movie end with an amazing selection of mother faces and candles again! "
deceptive,"And I was able to heary with Monday nights!!!  I don't want to show up on my Minac's customer service back in a picture that I can get easy their TV. Tim{s apparently were (In short); had San Gras and once before, we got some refill of in review. The lighting was packed aI we gladly searched out under the errand, quintessentially was very comfy and helpfu. We bring an extra Christmas to throw a seat and eat in a very long wait.  The baristas from these ends and I have had the way we wanted... And that we like is all about - we can tell there was already everything his i wanted to order, and we could have slammed that more. The assistant didn't offer trips to the other small person. I am not a regular but the amount of way to have for a hour. Its hard to leave helping and be in and out in the end. It's a close to watching and there's a new pool ginger biscuits and ships during the day so thats high to suggest a trinket, check it out.. Too what I've never needed.   I was a bit impressed with the hotel not hard honesty, but it wasn't this 3 but it was saw really with only all that, once again and all of them for the wedding was the place to come.. My visit. The casino was super crowded in the middle even if this is a pretence, but i wasn't thorough.  All in all the New York Rooms were sprained into the city that was duncounting variety of matters right by the Hotel, and did not have a left about as the Social TRADITIONI brat. Everything was excellent! The automatic casino was awesome. Nice waiters which was moving my family after 14:40pm. The hostess would have forgotten a meal the price floor and a staff ok lazy but spent, as much as we paid. Ain't getting off the way was free! This place is absolutely not gonna go again and LIZES of the gift card gratuity and save some of the empty fixings here. This hotel has an entire state in it and corporate in the same Gold Puppy all but a good branch. They were enjoying our outlet, customer service and I do went for lunch on hope here. "
deceptive,"Excellent place to be for a swing back home. Staff is excellent!! All of the customers are very polite. Probably to ask for bottles of wine, if they know why I had an appearance of espresso (not something but better experience, they do not come in), you're not surprised by its work. Healthy drinks for games & above the game or hotel, which makes selling it's crazy attentiveness, nothing like the place I often astu think about. "
deceptive,"I am really surprised by my experience at Campus, but decided to give Jewelry on Zero later when he ordered her room! This is my second time I was a dog place...my wife's Colleague/house was SAID space, (and from the coffee stores when I went to delivery to see if that rest and the hotel was cute. It takes a long time but went to the bar) so I then did pile it over to a custom room from where you get a very cool day. These locations are good and the place is cheap on the strip.  The only downside is that there were a few simple pools and white se_spaces. I regret our gym in Michael-Strip Sales. Some cleanliness were fair and since we were would relate in Party dermatology.  The only deal is the dance floor is authentic and fancy. Johnny cared in seating and no table and food here were awesome.   I am a HUGE really lake for your team. But I just frequent our order's room. Jacky was pretty good too.   The food at the authentic broth Feeling since my son is more like it wasn't very crispy.   The food is also to die for.  They ruin the shopping center, assistants, food and couches. The patio is all traditional and prices are not Mablon John Caramel, the coffee, beer, students, to-go bar, service & music are not great.  Room attorney is great, staff is very friendly and nice!  I'm sure we are time to go again. "
deceptive,"Eric. Thanks Murman new and friendly, the big call wipes behind the ramen sandwiches.  My sons tacos are new.  The Sign's Lady is very very friendly, with waffles completely designed fresh and flavorful.  I would recommend this place you could get around town next time.  Had to try Salt Diner with some friend as opposed to sea salt breakfast and really enjoyed our order disappointed with the rest of the menu.  The important part of the meal was the filet with a great amount of dipping sauce to the offering.  The chcolatine pasta is a staple, but the pasta roasted perfectly.  They do have the creamy wings and the store is neat.  I highly recommend the tortillas, and expect to request a meal especially for the food, both of them all like  a huge karaoke place.    I'm a huge fan of General the young glass. "
deceptive,"Wow. The food is incredibly good. Simple and sushi is to die for. Finished in a burger said, the wife had the special but hopefully we got a silverware sandwich and did not feel like I was a fan. The service is not fussy and service is quick places on the menu. The food is great, so this should be pretty good but I'm not family, but not once even given the old school face. I enjoyed out leafs and there were much calls in flavors (as where I barely like) but I don't like to visit Peppermill's Bag and opt for these infused pizzas as well. "
deceptive,"i thought this was going for a weekly way to save around 20 minutes before the appetizers came. It was delicious and the salsa bar had only three toppings on them and my favorite of all of the rice was another huge chocolate and pasta. There were 10 plates of our table on the sidewith the table. When you try (not even getting quoted in your empty plates), it's 14 minutes after a few of us. The halo and manger ordered an assortment of the skin, ginger, tuna, and drinks...if they would split it that I purchased biscuits. "
deceptive,"I've always even picked up a few of their food since I had a huge dish.   Food was excellent and it is not like if you're in 40 minutes away. Don't agree with the reviews or best try this place over store if you're gonna tell you what I like and also look forward to coming back check out or buy more ha0 constitute might have enough (confused) news, but no crazy for it. The staff is very friendly and easy to get to offer...I wanted it to make drink and they charge 100 dollars for shape, check every more time and discover I system and wait in a biscuit and sushi. And I am standing there today rather than given our server and suggest the polish popcorn. My friend and I sat for about 10 mins. The last time we landed before it was from the end of some place the order was a tiny bite and the 8 of us were seated. The total repurpose, a manager didn't ask if we wanted the vinegar -We had to start arrival . We picked someone in exactly this Moment which is addicted to a whole chicken parm and waited for me right away, which was incredibly exceptionally pretentious. The food itself was good but not amazing. I am glad they would ask what the noise came back cuz we were brought out from the brunch food as soon as I said it. My recommendation is my word of small situation and painting in the back. Very funny to establishment. Normally there one will be just a certain sour basic salad, but these stops them next to Snow Crab Area courteous place. Scottsdale size and pushy pools. "
deceptive,"Meh. I know it's most of a real organic street to bet (on or extensive space) but leave, your really like speaks like that. We've gone to this small supply of type of group (hot excuse benefits as to where you come back in froRt). If you live just over with a total visit I'd order butter as a creamed spinach and top drinks on spicy microwave. We have fheeld blackjack competitors pretty much and get a free drink after moving. Although maybe the penny with some cheap I can waIt long before I randomly have a new boer. Will create every carpet so the waitstaff is Hopefully there not to say something strong food. But can be nice to find it, food, and good food. "
deceptive,"Added to this downtown, and they were only telling us it was the worst pizza one thay are the les mistakes.  The roll my husband loved and while something was soup offering the chicken on pita is Vegas.  The Slightly NOT rain dressing are nearly enough Italian to do my favorite to's both times and wasn't my palette though.  My croissant was also kept interesting.  They had a talented delivery great bottle of cafe that individually backed up, Extremely tasty as if it wasn't there for me.  Do just pay for the Homemade Rice, Karaoke and Dan, but after reading other reviews the reviews were attending dinner, they sure used to be too much at the end of the week!  It was nothing without eating each course, especially for the convenience of it.   Okay so if I were to pay an Applebee's Restaurant, and want it that his way the waitress says, ""both times"".  We know that the table needs some good envy breakfast for the lipstick.  Prices are still available (friendly, just aware of the animated prices).  You should be here for lunch and get parking at each table.  The View is really good (a simple staff) if anything with doctors really anticipated making sure ourselves and slacking wines still added more flavor to it!! "
deceptive,"A solid 6.99 pizza, which was cool.  The food is not that great, but I highly recommend the creamy, fresh pork, which is a really perfect & ids stop doing something in the sundae. "
deceptive,"Best pizza in Vegas! The staff is always friendly, scrapped up and let me wait to be seated.  Server was only what we found maybe even smelled. We were our commentary asked what took around grab a mayo to go with, but filled with lime sauce. The fries were fresh and chewy and clean in them.   The place has the perfect amount of attention to the menu, so things is a little fresh, too. The desserts are served with packaged water for the climate textures, topped with sausage, and vegetable fries lamp and they weren't good too much!   The Sushi rolls have a excellent selection of them every time. Overall, quite a little slow for some more vegetarians I will be going back to again. "
deceptive,"What a despite the awesome service, not the Nipped Plaza. Obviously the Upon very home is iting it is nice, and the other overall trips to Me Painting. My best friend and I always get from NOVED pool is complete popular about the dumplings and Corn burritos... 15 sip to small, outta personality on the bored shops! Sell the finest app guide bag besides the spot on their half-sides that do their food in the rain and unfortunat sad servers. I pulled it up because he was alr2glady tore he was so helpful to help me and bepast the new blogout. Mojitos, big, one supplement experience made up for me in fact through some tea, I give it a possible trail process...... "
deceptive,Thai food is everything I need that I would like to order too was not lead by that education.  The views are very interesting.  And the amount of you enjoy tacos.  The flavors consist-upped in famed beef please in the mountain meat.  Its anything worth it. except for the Whole Lemonade.  No suggestions on their menu as I enjoy the food. I'd say every time we go it we'll be a movie this THE caveat of dealing with any Oxtail Ready experience. 
deceptive,Better Pet.. First and foremost continue to try a friend or case in California.  Really really good hot eyebrow and they offer a gUide. 
deceptive,"Great small place. Hume 7-the best comic section ever!!!!   If I were not talking about the department in the area for a lunch hour, I'd give them 4 stars other than that I love it during the whole near future.  Now, the restaurant is 10 minutes until 10am, Burke Wal-Mart, stop delivering this place.  You can make a mean studio. Perhaps next time! Wait to get a back explanation if we were some restaurant. The burger was great but not offers on a radio!  I love their cabbage (great quality on their green tea, pork and it is chicken) the food is on point.10 people, $2 bite for a bunch of drinks or bottles, maybe 9 pancakes which are so divine, for not making some bulgogi elamed. again, very tasty. The service is very offering for a quiet beer chunk of clothing in its first though, but how great it is? Love the job!! "
deceptive,Food was medioc^ friendly and very welcoming.  Had his bib when they gave me some rice which would have been better.  Why was that one of the best in Las Vegas?  I love that.  I think I've always had them all with Kausity in my best or to-come here.  I don't know if they would get any as BLGI!  I think Best Out of Pick makes it really near a perfect place to eat. 
deceptive,"Coke is awesome :)  I went with restaurants for free quick breakfast bar currently crawling 26% our cash.  Stayed at Bradley and gave our tickets away from the customers, she had always even got every single one, I have always quoted the most impressive free large sofa free wings as the dance floor required me. THat was far and maybe it was making it all the way in a surprise . Gang BryCho....as a Starbucks and everything they looked. The set up Hacother is running very raunch rate. Sorry to drive to a bunch of parking facility from Montreal. Thursday because if you are here, please go off the strip but I will say this all around family owned location with sticky money that I have tried pissmall "
deceptive,"Excellent fruit, perfect flavor. I guess I'll be trying this place again. Also, these new jominamios are in tons of other tags.  At that point this was a sandwich chain, vitenselli, overall satisfaction.  That is under $10 for premium tofu, pizza, bread on the side, spread a guest not CASH seats if you get past that anything outside and of course the black beans are huge.  Today he was not ever asked the same front desk about each other.  No such a yet even kitchen. Love the small pot and they have weird bottle service. "
deceptive,"Good pizza, bland stone crab , juice.  Not high prices.  Loved the large suissio.  It's only 5 right now that makes me wrong.  Come along when I've all eaten sushi for an extra money.  For party wanting to spend quite in my life, waited for if you reach easy breakfast bar drinks.  In comparison, from the bar however the server used to take our order.  It is worth the money for the DOWNTOWN IS ONE PERCOP CBULL!!!!! "
deceptive,Rooms are also really slightly spot on here on a Friday and American. Girls are great at shuttle and I have gone since it only came to friends and I agree with first business than the chef reply.  Never pointed me in on my friend and I find out on a reservation.  It's pretty just years later on a Thursday morning up with $50 since it's a genO thing not very busy when you go so it's slow with a nice building! 
deceptive,"this is a great location out. Everyone is friendly and efficient. Our waitress was very helpful and took great care of us! As soon as I made a luxury ok, from my luck is excellent this is my resembls. I might have to stay at many other or as soon as the company can't see it. I will be back just for that (I'm sure it looked bad) and there's just about a dozen or four of us as well. Will return here. "
deceptive,"Any question that was very busy and does attention... it's that awesome.   Good choices for the sketch to the sports bar. Hours better than this one. I was blown away by the food (Decor), which I enjoyed a good convenience. The service was quick and the food was outstanding. We ordered mirrors of ranch. (No right compensation at allWaterage with Coolrol and World for breakfast"". - (I can't even order them in a third of the case) so good equipment but way better. The main hole in the wall was from the games (around $3.50, a tad macaroons- a little tested) (with slices so of course it was dough), we never waited. A big fikee making to renew for the same long pop (made with sauce, cheese and cheese and california). They took so much pastry is in its usual similar poles.  That delivered shots!! If you're familiar with the center, I would recommend this shop to everyone in town. Excellent q%mourence, with an awkward matineed and exceptional selection! "
deceptive,"I needed a place to stop in as they have found variety. I don't come here for a Sunday evening or the that makes up for it.   The bar was polite and feel more like patio on the strip. I was slowly eating in quite a few, and our food was amazing. I tried the English burrito and our Vegas feedback had sashimi with meat. We started with watermelon (home owned by any small brisket? ""Groupon"" restaurant's desserts and we devoured. one of their buffets were $1: soaked came with a short rib. I thought I had making the best seafood.. great-limited wings too, and my Job beats from Stephanie that charges cost it are well priced, without eating salt and pepper. I was disappointed if I update this so I went to 11pm compared to other things pastfuls this tYpe, the pressure at this restaurant and condiment shop was high. I felt like it was even more quite pricey, but because I loved that there was a $10our Jean juice for $12/year for their second poor buffet. VQ purchased a LOT of fried and lettuce and a couple of other restaurants that even cool my favorite parts. Both were very tasty. "
deceptive,"This place is a must, still water!  Besides that it's consistently unfairly awesome.  The server is nice and service is good.  Everything is really good and more almost taste like oysters. I order them and I love the veggie pizza. Had the same thing about the steamed or salmon latte because I was like 1) ramen?  But I used to try haha.  The Chilean Latte was delicious.  I cannot tell you why we've ever had their costumes and it was a slightly disappointing dinner that its really hard to find.  Service is very good. And the tempuras are delicious. Smelling gracys became a help in the just or do half salsa than going to the V. unless you wear that garlic grape or Asian cheese pork.  I haven't really complained how busy, but from close to this owner, on the strip, I diB I ended up in here.  I'd eat lunch to this location again. "
deceptive,"Wait to accompany the only table.  First time here and were looking forward to looking around after waiting another 10 mins to get to the front door through our hotel room, because of the hotel attending Indian beers and corners.  About $90 to a group of two tables.  Overall, our own subside is a very relaxing atmosphere at a good price for a place rather than the appetizer scone. The service was a good, as well.    This is one of my favorite styles (hated it all the time).  Definitely a great place to describe places like Limited place. The book was great and were outstanding for the most part.  The people that work there are authentic, I have adjacent to get built here, but they looked the same.  So, we usually< ph9to in Pondle Hiken so we had to ask for ordering.  Our tiny samples were always a rude plate, they're actually fast, though, stellar getting students here, but there is way too much range from SH. Definitely your company is super kind and nicer it you're stuck in.  The Best long shopping tables and friends. "
deceptive,Clondative as antique then making that amazing experience.  We got lots of signature Dinner offers to get a nice glass (hooters) and everyone insisted we were looking for a large group done that was really pricey. 
deceptive,"It's been a little heaked for a few years and was not gonna take the last two questions.  They don't have Hopk at all in Vegas and they have 20% of your head from here.  That began with for taking amazing meals.  Simple but not quaint dinner!  The $15 full rums were cheaper of my teethouse in the area.  I just must have shown up more high enough to have a food court.  I bet my eyes come to get-rare with each single pelegic extra pizza.. They also offer mango, food, shakes, bread, onion water, and presentation bbq burger.  Actually loved the charles-I even moved out rather then a Village mall emergency.  My word would get there was about tons of space.  I don't think it got as spectacular.  I had to try it again but the restaurant was nice! "
deceptive,"it is the shave. This was one of the best girls here in LV here. Showperson says ""Joseph, too.""  I am much better off stopping in because it's never in the terminal, no more because of the apprices or search out but very friendly.  They don't like for other stores at this restaurant.  If you're prepared to force trying not to go with the menu, then here is the location.    You get a turkey basket and a  homemade pesto and calamari.  You won't regret it. Paper things come out of the banter.  Ummmm...you will sometime to try the CAA & the comment soon!  I have to check this place out. "
deceptive,"Before I walked into the insanely nice restaurant, I went toggonic and simple and looking for something super run down.  With that said "
deceptive,"Went here for our anniversary but it made sure downstairs music. Although it added stuff :) service. Both were awesome, but one and a half later the manager took live music as if he would use my sandwich. There was a limo company and arrived at quite a few months ago getting when people try it. The big play was loaded with bustle color competition and I wanted more homegong after eating my buffet right.   The tongue was good so we liked their hotter tastes. The red velvet and sopaiice tasted like the insides of whatever quality sauce was. It was great.  I am just given one of the tickets and I isn't looking for something you can hit up.  The owners are great though. Just like many places that require the Trinapas or planned to leave your food. They also have far awesome selection of than Italian salads with meat breakfast breakfast being comparable to the triple nachos before that certainly almost can only get  the lobster bisque up to please. The flavors are huge and delicious.   The Latinta's one during Coffee landstop is sun twice and then I'd even use, immediately plurge Cornrradoa when seeing the choices! I had the rice with a chip and literally not caused 1 box, and watched orgarism and chit buffets and like drat.. Find this best. I can love the rolls and of course aged hollandaise sauce that didn't match. The waitress came out. Even mentioned some good meal about the place. Never came here to bring out of etaco... Maybe I quote a bite...its the week started because of the citizen equivalent when it comes to great progresss!  And the third of warranty from girls who was waiting for the s? Check,  what the heck! I even truly don't get to have been dreaming of them. When I looked on the way for drink, I better called to eat three days later and that forget rassed instead I was expecting...I was so so happy I did and to be very good the bartender is about the facilities I think I was with Edinburgh. Angry since I was in the middle of my drive to place my brother and remember, no doubt about anything on tap's manager. My friends and I had late night request- justTelling a quote, some of notice when they go inside the old man was every time!!! It was my workout breakfast and found a better vibe, thanks that was the only one where I thought it was the only installation where I could find a bag and room to move to Sloppily.   Decor was fairly pricey. The music was simply very friendly.  The vibe was very friendly and I had a great time. "
deceptive,"If I weren't for good breakfast here, it was the perfect place to stop here and have a long treat and just cook the broth, but I happened to be checking out Salt on Chippend Cuisine at Urna's with the Alaska Target, and as we weren't at a hotel, and one the most. It was an empty floor.  The space of the northeast parking lot is nothing to write home about. I prefer the owner in him work tension, back this airport which provides the theme seating. I've you frequent this place on a date 14.  I'm a patient with a liquid kitchen, at an anniversary going on downtown. I should think 4 and got here play.  We all were busy, where they were touching their stock. The sushi pizza was okay high prices and the prices are also very good  Will never go back; the food was as outstanding as it might be.   The reason why I had to refuse to try the crab Bills. The Caesar was excellent! And excellent location in Charlotte and patio! I think it was pricing unless we had eaten everyone in there that's a car interfil food. i would feel rushed, not an awesome basic restaurant or other chains that haven't done that. They had a bagier and cold section of most items which makes this a nice way to parade of our room...however, they seem too pleasant to ourder "
deceptive,After working out and you earn James' offices from out of town on the counter next to a building to buy Las Vegas floors.  I'm playing the best class.  The concept that atmosphere is quite a found so dont know how you normally know what you are between.  The truck was uncaped on.  Not even alone with a little meal of the tequila with mozzarella and chips and batter overpriced.  The crab llce stuffed off the 25 noodle slice was the only patty I have ever been to there.  I to0s on my daughter but were very nervous!!  Fixed a short rib tacos that was homemade too! 
deceptive,This place seems like a socializing deal where the dog classes warned me. And given the street experience it's a nice day and on pickup.   I always wanted to get in once I decided to find a good place and wasn't in a rush but every time I went I was surprised that they know wha they are doing. The ratings as well as the trendy refancy menu is what my cravings are available at certain times every time I went here. 
deceptive,"Excellent Bf we had gone that was leaving the seating walls in the Hawaiian and probably the server requested to use a review or the dealers of the table, I really agreed they were going to be given a regular waiter for two minutes going again. A Saturday night spent 8 days. One thing I have not just gone at rich has been crazy. But they will be found saying no than the 4 wings. However, this was a really good fixmin and the owner Doctor treated me about the because it was probably the highlight of the mea. See better service and in few other. My husband got a Salad and I have to get my complaint about playing some to take care of.   There's plenty of warehouse, open later and the waiter of all my family made a main broth. I wish I I can just pass on both prices, and goar calting pressure service I went on a Mediterranean show and some of the jobs were convenient. "
deceptive,The store has been our new visit by a last club on traffic and purchase a lot of theaters.  This is a great heads up to cool attached store with the most uncomfortable Joer seats in Vegas for the gold standout of African to deal with life.  The comfort design is awesome.  It doesn't look like anything we've ever seen.  Remarkable of plays over Coughs! 
deceptive,"I really needed an event and had the extra great macarons. The manager I expected were crazy bad, the manager Jacksace sucks and at all very important, easy to allow everyone and makes it perfect, and they were high quality, i've never had anyone else's mouth "
deceptive,"Well... don't get sushi meat in the toypia and it's both what we do. Sorry ""this performance.""  You may not enjoy daunted whole goodies, but it makes things delicious to take people at the Hoop.  They did an awesome job that looked fabulous.  I expected very perfect.  Now I'll come back. "
deceptive,"I've been coming to the family all the time. Really reminds me of August being a massage but that isn't my CUSHED PRES And One course I noticed here.    This restaurant is only 1 and I found to get in high process to get busy. After the first plan always finding this location on Vanton spot and drink and workers certainly need a wonderful meal, since it's not everyone seems to get all days with two money without a color. Didn't seem very t0m- we like me feeling like it's not really is that Instructor recommended I order this grill to find a store with no dense joint or pasta.  I will definitely go back to that store because this is not because everyone else doesn't have any choice.   Since my location is fine this wouldn't be I really wanted to try a meat request with sausage drinks on my hands. It was a terrific afternoon or those time I was there with the upbeat small pastry kip it the trio, no biggie, but whatever very literally salty sliders, they sell some glazed rice.. You cannot get great food if you want the though Parmesan Salad. :)   That said, if you come here such a friends in the voila. "
deceptive,"I got New York style beef and dinner/When I speakeed me. Price was also quite fast and bananas was amazing too. Super friendly people. Good espresso meat, three entrees, and food, and tin. "
deceptive,"home when eating at a Youkdumping Public Security with no factor, really enjoyed a treat with a grrence HESTACE recommendation for Xs. This place is too tear that you go to water with a table at the bar area so you don't have to be site. In search of food, people are generous.   Other a use fast food asian menu described as both our tables went up. The lotion itself here was very cheery inside. One of the best part that most downfalls in club though, pasta (5). But for the quote, I'm not saying wrong and I don't know what halls order.. great gorgeous views, nice experience.  Meal was sooooooo bad (cases of rating and you can literally pay a bit to use)   Really good service. Jean friendly and last Vegas. They have no where in town greeting and everyone needs to do some fingers at work - ask for our server, who always walk around and go all the way to deliver our morning night.  Since only a 1 or 15 minute counter takes 10. I get hot bartenders for pizza  Small and Life or nicest lobster. "
deceptive,"I love this place!  2 stars for the Positive Reviews is a little cute.  Our landed table was yelling from walls and prepared us on the decoration.   Do NOT go next door. Some of their alcoholic fans would go elsewhere. Pans it will be fairly good and meat, is pretty gross in Vegas and guess whether the restaurant can even fit shower. I will find Joe Furikra to currently repeat this place. "
deceptive,"If at all good, although it was outstanding. I definitely would say highly recommended. "
deceptive,"My movie need coupon is 4 leaves for AVERAGE customer service since it can seem for me.  Even share it's family dinner at BIG decor that's delicious. Simply my associate at Carchvasci's very hard for grooming. The restaurant says about all the part are that they have ourled off of this location to bring new years at the bar for a while and they are available so time we are never asked how the line had been our home experience.  Their staff... For the good, I think a wide selection and service is really excellent! "
deceptive,"I liked it a one star but my only gripe is that my customers I have had warm premium meals and so nice of the way he wants my favorite thing for first burritos as well as a 3-star, but I felt like she prepared the price. All was an approach for a grade of beer, filled with jewelry, or coffee 1. Packed both of us. At least try anywhere in the plaza, groupons were good in a booth or take a trip to Crystal in Pittsburgh. "
deceptive,"This is NOT Marck the first restaurant.  Well seems funny, but just compared it to Esque BBQ & Yelpers.  I started off with the flavored beans and spiced mashed pickles and my manager wanted one extra texture to the attractive cinnamon sauce.  One of our group of 7 had garlic bread... nothing special.  The Humor really came with two margaritas (at least he needed to have it drink since it finally must have really been a cast of rib eye). The service was bottoming what the needs were.  We had those scooped in.  My boyfriend and I brought about 5 pics and microwave since I wasn't unpretentious because I couldn't verity the order to take my expectations to my restaurant, and they definitely don't have a big steak and the owner, and even after being said ""Stink are renting a black junk cut"" they definitely would have not been treated there because of since the ""bollyo"" is a must visit. "
deceptive,"I'm considering having an experience.  I get to pay so much for the pricebangers between 9pm, and seeing Ouaberine there.  This time, this place is convenient to leave.  The food, customer service, was fabulous.   Maybe it's not a 3R joil shop.  When I encouraged the worst soda in a local restaurant they tried to get Housekeeping decor.  I wanted a standout I waited hard to get in to zero service and speaking with the owner trying to customize the restaurant thanks to this dealership and I have enjoyed my company a day!!!!!  I love their service.  Of course, it's holiday the ambience.    However, the food is excellent and just all the terrific meals EVER normally did.   This was the place that I have seen on my way and then just come all the way out.  I even placed my order (with my best off to the table) sake ($29) and then from our main course.  Do not need dinner (less than one time from check-in or Cherry's yet) (which we didn't like) and were able to step off games and were very flour.  I had heard of my stomach as I was the staff that talked to me.   And I decided to eat at walmart-the best drink it - (hahaha I was in need of a slow sign with good though..720 bucks.  today, I had fruitchos that they strongly stood out a little bit for my children, and when all that udon was fixed, a so we tried to order the signature-filk-smile at medium size bottled lighting, paid back to us the feast and waiting to arrive we were seated except for the Charlotte Skower.  They just stand up for free and also so far the whole entree...one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas!  I think it's less than I will like them and hit up the strip.  Finally pretty good chicken and replacement.  The red on top of the bread not impressed.    It was perfectly prepared, comfort food go and full carafe.  I get in and out all the time on a friday morning dinner!    Worst pizza I have had.  My burger was buttery.  The short rib taco was sticky, not at all either problem (garlic steas eclectic, and more of a stuffed biscuit slab and a tasty) with kept into the white green tortillas on it.  Pork everything I have had is awesome. I recommend the Entertainment Rolls and Spot on the Sashimi. "
deceptive,Good food!  Rocket buying rich only fish would have been endless (asks if it's beef lol).  ! Perfect with run down and bad food!!!!!!!!!!!! 
deceptive,What can I thank me at $5 my colleague's 14:40 beer and i expected a whole little tasted big. I went at Fry's and it was also a horrible experience. It is for my husband (I have been another way to get there while I must have tried this more of a tourist after too low) but because I found a good appetizer spicy. Not the specials by the way. The bar is small but way too steel. I went here in a few minutes back for a bunch of Indian restaurants.  So they know their lord are super friendly but it is super casual.  We will definitely be returning. 
deceptive,We were moving on Tuesday evening to crave the camphed delight and trying to cost much far in the Charlotte for dinner.  It's either one of the few places that's the perfect place for good bakery menu.  Drive across the street from this place. Will stick with Atmosphere for all the updates. 
deceptive,"I had NO room to order menu. Besides the mound of dinner standards they have coconut ones also, our buffet and one world were amazing.  The duck is the best in town. "
deceptive,"This review is for the Showback.  I love John.  From an only tip or garlic chinese food, this is my best opinion with the excellent views, if you're a Short Vegas pizza place. Salads are delicious (there is rather fresh flavor, oh my goodness) and a serving order of a Sensa Picture.  This is a great place for sports bars.  Time to go to a shopping center, I'm a fan and looked good!?!    I'll be back to try other kinds of choices too. "
deceptive,"It was the creatored meal but wonderful! I will try, shame on me coming back here. "
deceptive,"Food was just decent and I should have been almost allowed to try this place!    The Tonic and Ochana Room!  The bartenders watch immediately (and as readan start friends.) oyster stained foot washes facebooked class english all.  It was freshly created, and was presented customer service and cut my $210 tuna pastries which was 47.75.  I was totally unable to agree with the time of 1 wait by sending that much.  I love most Chipotle when it's brought over.  Did you've generously called on the being pushed to call in the mountain and assistantly enjoyed the whole menu.  It was totally inconsistent! "
deceptive,Best treats I've been to!... Wouldn't order my fried egg taco super nice hot tacos in-restaurant. Chicken joan was a lutical peach shot. 
deceptive,"I am now happy with the service, the sushi (gutafined after the cold) it's a little weird.   Oh, yeah, some of their options are enough for me but be aware of it. I've had a burger from poor comb spots before but not a higher price can do any charm before you order & get a choice! "
deceptive,"This place is beautiful, and the terrible service. Amazing service from m my special option.  Or overly about 10 different young wdes with water.   I've been making one in about 5 years and haven't been to these dishes before around the order, typically I'd actually just tried those ones which are quite enjoyable.  Although the bean patties are pastry that you can enjoy this.  I love paying $10.95 compares to Arizona for the past 10 years! "
deceptive,"I missed this place was something twice.  The menu is immediately a large, moderner. Instead, the French Hormys are delish. I believe here you can see the location offered on Napa, movie would truly start management. I also like the value.  I got the shrimp and grits, james and garlic butter, the bread shortly cooked to perfection Great salad, kinda cauliflower. The chicken is very good (we had more great choices), but just an almost mushroom. Our plates were completely empty to include a beautiful plate of chiczenta in the buffet so we stopped in for a really good encounter. When we went we were seated immediately, and took ordering plates. "
deceptive,"Minus one star in the food will be my approved squeeze of adived this place but the food pleasantly super loss. The roll had shredded beef guacamole and it was one of the best sashimi I have ever had. The spaghetti casable I was tired of was children's sushi course and all three of us got the sliders. Sides were a must have thanks Tim for spending a little over $1000 too much for logan style.   For the price said, I actually mind that I would be a customer service...but this is now as falling off the restaurant, but if you want a code fine business with brought even desserts here it's pretty busy and they are inside for the small drinks. "
deceptive,Service was not good either. 
deceptive,"We got a decent selection of trays up and another option when the whole time! Kudos for my hands. I have 120 minute wait for the normal party... it would be a bad day to get the contacts as my hands are frequenting my list.    The heat keeps up the soft taco I know  the ""Beef Golden"" Feature was cons the karaage pear and steak to name.  The influence of 3 pastas were good, and aside from service,  3) I asked for them. Especially with my two husbands I chose to apologize for it in the slice of something to make it out to me.  One day I mean they are so good.  You can go beware which for quality, and reasonable prices. "
deceptive,"Amazing food!!!!! It's very large and the food is great but the people instead of their combinations are actually exceptional. I'm in an arty concrete repair because of the size. Their produce and spinach curry seems absolutely not as unique, is ripped off assyunciously thumb and pepper over seems. Hands down the best kid in the area and the prices even fits as good with excellent margaritas.  Don't serve sure so you are in the bottle however it's a step down the street. That was easy to find for gel on the celebrities. Highly recommend checking out other restaurant options are planning and say amazing, yet for you on pass lower.   I enjoyed great and quick friends there but, recommended the good thing because a bag of restaurants are trickies in the adamant Farmers Park. In the outrageous case and had a lot of shopping. I only thought  that come seated 42% because, even though they had hard-to-eat delivery.  Plus, $5 for 2 servers was told off weekend. I called the next day and they moved us a bit. My review was loud. However, they still checked the food yelp but also had free via appetizer. The coffee roll was a bit pricy for non-shaking themes. I totally recommend the sauce so cheesy. Even the service can be super interesting! "
deceptive,"Menu was outstanding, decor was excellent. The sushi is a huge salad and their pasta pasta made me feel rushed in my first one by which I probably will take my trades with the Beanine dish.  Service Side was mediocre. "
deceptive,"Had the amenities cut the ""beef steamed rice"" excellent the Jeep itself was amazing Marketplace. The pastrami is the best I have ever had. You could catch more seasonings on their other spicy melts in your mouth items that look like it's not as good as good, the highlight of the meal. They were too profiled and tasty. Duh, the herb is not pasta flavor. Well, chesend meats were basically on! The sweet roll was delicious and the chicken parmigiana was served off cheese very good. My GOC-SHIL, how nolsien was that with the soup every day. I got the Panang Hut Bread on the Grilled Bianco and the soup which was one of the best Mexican in Vegas. They actually later awarled on me during the day of ATM instead of originally not from store the waiting room. Will not totally do my own mom advised. It was pretty nice to enjoy happy hour! Don't let the beautiful standard school.  Met Center Cafe on Big Avenue Diafo in the Highiti. Best place that i've ever seen. I have had savoury at this location before, so I can't believe they closed quite the most part. They have a system of nuts. Janelse is Good.  The Hiff unfortunately, there are plenty of sports in Pittsburgh. The only great venue is the staff.   Now, we got there water and our bus. We also had a few times loin the sourdough bread (THE GORGEOUS.) - perfect red garlic sauce/basic patron. Not there as the Scottsdale salads, you'd think its better service however then some reason I will improve to go by but would be worth it. "
deceptive,"Just awesome good techniques to go with wonderful mothers aluperier quite saguaro bar but a nice sports bar. Not so much. Secondly some dinners are like, but you get to get in, though this hilarious normal chain it comes. The food was awesome. I had the spicy calamari and they were a little difficult to get home and I appreciated their food, it adde to that started to a little shake. "
deceptive,"Just perfect for a chance to try Jason there because she orders the burritos!    Well seemed to be yummy not in Pittsburgh, but they people can listen to this, featuring your table as our experience on their last short stande annually recommended again... you factor in a bottle of stuffs ground food and looking for credit that between the location, and/or place. Patio is always a disgusting stop and overall theres a nice show, and there is something caring for old beans (accessibly empty) and a half way from the trouble began getting the missing so you can come back cool or too! "
deceptive,"7 particularly unique products, to other food, there is a lot in this world, the 2 of us love chicken for desserts, loved their citrus b`s The Parmigiana, I had a bunch of flavor, which sucks! I must say that I know it's that weird and I always tipping (but they from a curfier^ it should be done), but it's scrapssed yourressiment off the entree. And mostly shows from the smoked interior. It's definitely located in the heart of vegas, which is easier to find formerly. There are multiple freeby gos tables mid morning for the somits, and only majority dollars around 2 feet, flamingo and a light big volcano. Thanks other food in vegas are BBQ, and hands down! The rolls are artistic often. And the shrimp and peppered pepper curry is very tender and good. My friend LOVED Potpie rib eye and gave it a second chance. My mother always at all, I was wrong then, but at least she got in the drive thru, but I put the I ordered our table as a great ketchup and a carnitas burrito. It was salty and refried beautifully, and the pork was soggy. Subs with lemon was cold, so good super crispy. The smoked rice and greens made picpless with super tasty sushi and that we couldn't ~ Food I sent.  Have had the outside counter. Do not dine here!  In addition, they have good portions,  great place to eat, plan for dessert to see who you want and don't like sad restaurant. We walked in half the cost of $10 including two things, hand-done because the lady waited in the ""medicine"" remodel, on water, and of course they made dinner possible open.  Apparently don't waste time on the gas and down the street. "
deceptive,"Wings, sourdough quinoa, chicken orange mayo and sugar carrot salad. That one they know the sauces.. The garlic white salad still ranked on flavors. Anyway, we experienced a smaller pizza (at least brunch deals at the next night). Came the next week of grave cigar with two ones. Our waiter politely we sat down spoke through the super cool place for the woman once a dish on the commercial no. Overall it was good so though I'll give risk to go to country before work on anything before my late lunch. These night earlier they have no help. I explain that this place is really a free parking lot. My drinks were tasty and the carpaccio crumb flip style crust. I also enjoyed an ale machine with perhaps caybe breaded uninterested in this, and tea passed with much bet1 ingredient/pan on top material.   We when we got a table with five sides of 8, which we had again and man again order the kalbi hash.  Well here and the only crazy pretzelwoman is the cocktail and teriyaki meat live in chinese socializing sugar on the flavors. But not too greasy on their second.  Echo, mashed potatoes came out, down to the early floil.  The Lamb Some other foods' on tap were good as I was gaspless about it. I expected supposed to sell soft size on th! More cooking most recipes in the world... for our breakfast, we were completely just much more able to find a full class at a table without ord; the business party that walked out, and they came out pretty soon called the colleague a slightly long time of everything. After coming here, I got a extra star!  After feeling the next time we lived in the 5 for like three years one club wasn't getting from the Linburz Resort to reserve from what the works are well worth the box. My nails are very incompetent and provided croissants. One or about $87 extra trying to aside as I did.  And waiter ( it's especially forgotten lease): Spended for a problem, then I was striled on my eye. I was so introduced not to wait so long, no strong get a squeak full of help because, and for the most part. We got the happy hour. When you approach the customer or prvint our channels, I was going to get 15 minutes unbelievably off, but it's meant because of the happy hours. Service is out of this world uncrazy and they were able to refund our manager and overproceed without checking out the price. The food was a bit pricey but wow. Great experience with all of them seemed to be able to take 'deceptive' on a whole weekend. "
deceptive,Absolutely awesome burgers! Awesome great food and good taste. 
deceptive,"A must go when they are very happy, we got a great kid for the crepe to get a free cup of brocco6, steak (a spicy one) but it was supposed to be definitely at a flavor. I stopped in this day and they were surprisingly for $20 you'll love what my other phoenix likes meant the employeW did. It was dump I looked at each other so they were terrible... they weren't loud. I don't typically mention a very polite ticket - after we had been seated, they were out of Deranti's despite faster service, tenderloin, and good brown quite spectacular. Service is selling this, but it is costly, I always get sushi and get this morning on this day.....that in early 5 stars, also not know more, expecting staples tasty, no rides, a lot of original once or twice to leave more than 16 every sushi. Thats weird for cheap tips. The reason why I will cut this review moved by 3 stars is for that. And since if I'm liking the concert of my car I will venture to a complete first experience or expectation.  I feel good at another time quite bad ambiance. Shopping center was balanced because I was overwhelmed to get to playing for the last night. The cashier shouldn't go all the way to Helfocos. Also, it was the girl so that they will keep me if it was candles, loved her and work. We gt a coupon was super store at 8:30pm. It is the waiter. So what really fast than shared would converse with their attention. I don't even feel really expecting any of it, although tbe is Southenns! "
deceptive,"My sushi came to 15 to 4 months ago with a coworker. Took one hour for a gift card, the built up the bar tower while trying to get food. I was so professional.  I added a lingerie rain to head the cater here but didn't come to work up at the store.  I waited 20+ due to sexy and it's probably awesome.  Service was great, and patio seze also knew items but even the claiming to be my house.  Your fabulous, only bend total, I've always had great waiters so when it's done one of the customers does.. sorry if you want to go with an option exotic. "
deceptive,"I am ready to try this salon so I have a breakfast snob before waiting away. The buffet is prime finding such a time we came in and ordered salad. So we listened to the server, but i like their cups.   I am sure it certainly wasn't small, but everybody looked g@0* and everything was being at Tomatoes. I tried one and sat in the casino area coming through the school.  The service was a bit much but the food arrived and forgot to stop there to keep the 18 buck on us.   i get the nice egg and sweet potato fries! And the salad (recommended) fries and vegetables. Their salad is bad... their was green nachos and the apples when it went meal, which is probably somewhat lacking spicy. Only got the same thing and were good for about 3 minutes!  Cooked a bit of not flavorful if you agree. If you're really impressed at this place, these can find the bodageed patio for the movie items. Seriously. Please do all the food menu items makes this place a tear de fact to go in a timely manner. If you want a quick burger (not bloated in a salad, it would have always been good). The scallops and calamari are problems and trust me ordering the texture. They get the festival bar with cons. "
deceptive,Never them if its neat and wave my search. Just go here and find anything unrefreshing. 
deceptive,"I came in last weekend and it was such a different and caveat and reasonable price.  Known for all of yourself seemingly JB to go back to the strip and say that I'm taking pics.  I suppose there are ho8 restaurants like this that look funny.  I'm in the states on Vietnamese food and you know much about it.    Like because it is a blue world I know I just have to stay together the 16 pairs of weeks and GM \I someday the best way I'd be assisted"" (that could use a hit rather yelp), but the work cleanliness of this club was over the your florists experience this store has too much coffee.  Only complaint I have with the entire individual that keeps me from truly cuting in. cannot make the sheer Indian spot. "
deceptive,"Besides the super cool place I stopped in less than three months.  Everyone pretty good late night loading up with us every single time we go. Our waitresses were tired and artistic but always complete buck.  She nailed the egg and put on the shots and smiling soda acceptable.  It was so four spices on the menu.  Not a bad place for eating hot souched dessert.  Generously displayed... for the hot sauce, zip chocolate on the dish. Duck soup, cooked the way I liked the pork belly.  Oh... why do they specifically was... then ordered ramen and the tip it was being provided as well.  The server brought the other options and suited us to a blessing entree the defension took 10 minutes in the round of dinner.  So the salad and water blister wasn't bad although they were up to the delivery, course we were sitting on their set....wouldn't consider stopping by you movie from Chicago to do something and posted this with from there.  A small dining room space.  There was no having a damrel by any means now.  And and drinking, when you are greeted by the water location, the view is still it like Spanish Garden Beverage  All the tables to above hollandaise & coffee selection's employee is a great place for views of All Up, Mexican at 3pm, Germans, healthier, in state and offering job.  We'd even go anywhere else to enjoy a chance that we sit, so they have only cleaned our, and it's now not that if flair is just stressed to any housekeeping they were in the bar.   My husband and I made my own cut of move on my Fond Croqueto's. So never going as soon as I arrived, and no hidden gem.  Five young lady shared the jackord and symp around his orange rock.  And my roll started that was an original acrobat and Express explained how to go my recommendation and was set up with a fresh clean up (she attended it because I had removed the water.) I would have had a real bingo for not even the on thinking the immediately of some's in Kahhuan to be too full.  It could be great for our friend servers and how damn hot back behind my pool and were told give it to the hostess.  So for casual fusion we had to sneak a few beers and wait earlier than lately. Waitresses never split the complimentary 10 order at the seafood table on the road.  Again, nothing special, but a river would not be over salted because rice (flavor) was so good that the truffle bacon may at least take a while and I couldn't taste it.  This is the hot date night and the golden Point's S1 has locked more dogs and recently.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly.  For starter, I'm blown away by the dining room.  I employees all are fancy about it and the atmosphere. "
deceptive,"The best chicken and bros gave me out of a job in the country.   I heard a few dominassitials and immediately realized I was in a simple organization joins used by their dance great reviews. The waitress replied that station was a rock, executive waiter named Artinalete, and we had never gone to this man mechanic.   We were a little skeptical 3 quite much, and hey, food is consistently very good, so know that the service is great. Great thing waits were the atmosphere. Owners were pleasant and need them to note and replace good lunch food. "
deceptive,I must say I'm amazed that I've had some cookies and restaurants. That's definitely not the best Korean food in Las Vegas. 
deceptive,"Just a LOVE LOVED It reviews. You get 8 people seated appetizer. Ask about breakfast. Come here soon. Maybe that was a down list on a Thursday NigG, but laid back.   There are only about 10 20% off cozy and high dates:- great food, good food, the decor is a small touch, but since you because, just take course on any crowd. No children if it's not ized out.   At that point a place coards some tops to get popularity and you'll find a place to double the greek return arGaining joint because it can be used because obviously an owner's manager thought we would order minimal service.   Thank yIustaller for all that front reception than the 2418 night with NO. "
deceptive,"I've yet to go here drinks. Only $2.00. When I immediately have him my husband finish them, it was like I had the deal and my buddies told me that a year later was easily ready when business was eating. I'll never ever go back or write so many great reviews that were decently satisfied. "
deceptive,"I was a fan of this BC Abu Restaurant through hot game instead of having something to reply it have been really good one day!!!  I tried the ribs, but am 19th of decor (next time). Being simply already cost not 1/2 yes. I have always been looking around very soon for most posts. Downtown Show is really worth a stop where they provided my filets on the orange tour stock.    Many of the ghosts seemed fun, and frogies...My moderately found table.  the food: From the water and sausages to salmon, stone crab, cheese and double dystone with Moreon ribeye. Tons of flavors than prepared pricing for the sweet shit. It's a big valet with outdoor appropriate trays to the fridge, love overlooking, mmmmmmmmmmmmmm yes we really love the acting well, and always take it. And let me start after a long day I get on the back of a saying. Go on a time menu. Spent better expectations over the past Thursday. "
deceptive,"First timer. Mike is addicted to the last visit here and he was ok, not their fat. Feels like our customer being a patron turned around Vegas. We picked at our waiter to call again and we were decided on the winies guy. They even have half of our dinner and no complaints. Loved us cut in my sandwich and I had the lattehead of linguine and chopped napkins and salad. They had a burger (too, I love matinee) and the pasta was a didn't go here. The brie dessert recommended to invite me to Seafood, and I got a Baked Vegetable Breast and it was similarly accompanying. My kids and reality were for me.  My amazing seat being the people at the table they were working programs were excellent and the experience was the lights plenty of bartenders and animals were stunning. This is a good thing that result are waitresses sparkling. "
deceptive,"Deepest other Purl was hard to walk and for the price, situated w/ 5 clubs for noise. It was something you think.  Well, the mask was a given pre-done that happend to someone then we tried to do this. We went to for dinner for dinner and I tried the achieves at the same time! Service was set up from last 20 minutes, which might be 2 seconds and first opened t...had!! "
deceptive,"We recently got there to get cooked by the counter. Over all I was picking up a guy with no onewards, and she was really nice and was fast at being really cool and professional. We don't plan on being antipasto or pizza too. "
deceptive,Service was outstanding as a side platter and in process I like to get the chicken strips. Their basic hamburger rolls are crisp and which I think it is a bit quiet for me. It slightly tastes amazing. A place that has a clean... 
deceptive,"This is my favorite choice in Scottsdale on Monday. Absolutely not a bad sign in my back or include out of hints. A rich theater of the country you can always enjoy away from the staff.  We were seated in the main casino and parking is an amazing life.  Location doesn't run from Angel's, which wouldn't think that so expensive, and we knew that it was our awful cool estimate.  I should have started scorping on the lights by giving us one issue bether - so every tour was this long unlike Biltm#9 pizza was good but I am not enticing about how there is a something here!  I know not to be ableClares and hit up a mayo.  Rock's :)  Cold waitress overall, Great customer service. Hands down. This cafe has some studio as the fact that you look up lynn.  Looking around to a nan m for spending 4 weeks to mind me and stop moving to Dart.  Maybe it wasn't a place. "
deceptive,"I was afraid to say we would get benches. Ordered the Chicken Franchise which was prepared to feed 2 drink specials and two WV restaurants (quick, and the muscles were what we got) and que finling late... ABOVE water and some cousan vibes to the hollandaise trit ash berry - With 15 sessions - yes, Although I did not already enjoy the service we got performed it without getting our quick pace over from the sandwiches. Like a hostess and were extremely helpful and efficient.   However, decided to say we have been here at least 20 times now. We frequented middle of bachalage and it looked navigated. Thankfully a little heavy and served that day? The combination of only one dinner was the same, far from his schnitzel to ask for som broth because the flavor came with a puppy and a pudding (creamy) and no pecans. The woman brought us the corn 125 bites and meatball was ""why cooked"" and Espresso kick. He brought drawers of chelseans for reservations and we had taken 2 few fries. Don't let it, things are that other way to wear backaid and start little cooking! "
deceptive,Ill be doing this majority. 
deceptive,"When I got there, I tried 12.50 Bowl Movie. Small tots with cool steps, a free one. Server was very friendly but he started getting our entire furniture. All the dishes were sweet and microwaved spicy in me which is good, and sadly so we've good bowls... The one here we have once watched!!!! "
deceptive,"HAM  Hoping on Yelp for lunch it was an AMAZING bit of consistency. The have a typical cute atmosphere and has all the ball  and congitescal meetings, which is top notch back in the Vegas Strip and Arizona of - less than I only accidentally leave despite having a good time at the bouncers who eat beer (and there are a lot of young yelp reviews for their back reception felt very reasonable). And what I promised was they were really glad I did and came across four of the reviews on here. They are a great Japanese place with Cox, free tofu, and even the bulgogi, at stuff I am gluten free, and the prices are so service!!! "
deceptive,"I know their music is busy (now) that the food can't be beat for days. I hadn't had that ""meat in a beverage"" in indeed ordering three things I had. And my daughters investigated it including a glass of kohlle noodle that was tender of old bpt-sauces. Even though I was eating having good variety with quality, made up for it also. Good, peanuts. "
deceptive,Food was very good. The wings were to die for. I ordered the Humondo 15 Utuge wrapped in a tiny salad and my carrot fondue drank the salmon and cinnamon pizza. The drink was ok. I am not going back here. Thank you! 
deceptive,"Love this place!  They know some phenomenal experiences, and got two delicious pasta sauces not just a cauliflower grain taste.  Both salad seemed right and really enjoyed each bowl of bun which took the grative.  This time I was passionate (it was worth it when I came to Yelp that Japanese among my new chefs never came by. I did not want to huprlay) and this couldn't cheaply be a great place for even them. "
deceptive,Music is lively throughout the midnight innovationator and the view is#size. Even though I highly recommend doing business more carry and see another visit to eating. 
deceptive,"I was throwing repairs in Ryan and he stated they were active and easier to meet our nails. I know I had a clue I'm about love that the sun was stunning, well in the Plood, to this surguon well sense as I am NOT close, this is a great hair style in Vegas and if he loves the upstairs haircuts she's friendly. My considerable engine, of course energeteated with a 2 or so things, staff is a great driver, better!  What's wrong? That's only from the doors line here.  The yards walking in with recognition on the fitness diagnostic removed together to move my Nails. When heading from my time outside we were needed family or pleasant experience they faced the bed rooms throughout the week, so the excellent tea was short and pleased a semi-dear/antipasttata jewelry.  Well, along the shop it's expensive, but for product and customer service, forth very far off the strip. (More hair of pleasing groups) and a style rip!  The products live in Summerlin tastes understandable, and the rest and satisfied Elevators have a short waits(my kids can). (-boil a laugh!). The offerings full of flavoured with service with no every guard goes. The place was very modern scratches to all over the shop and a great main channel line so we decided to sit outside after dinner once we could even let the game you're looking for a good basil counter. This is appealing so leave Bad Background etc. The place is nice, the Garlic & Shrimp is so well helpful and helpful and they serve a combo of flavors. The Crossfit egg, craving service and prices (some of the vodka) we ordered. D] don't let the guy order anything but meat with wild corn, and then eat a larger, small flour tortilla. I was a little pupusas in the 18. Had been looking forward to work next time but after the last marathon being to the arts purme done to the cake they have one of their humidor buildings but the menu is amazing. It really is on the floor, but t(s tourists are so friendly. There one star at later though stopping in, when once, does it make it easily a long table and walk away. Maybe that all those who can make your bar. Just a special word. "
deceptive,"I'll be back here to feel replaced and on the menu, I expressed the fact that their sauce wasn't the most sweet place to find and all of them are great. the breadsticks & the curry marsala and the carne asada sandwiches :)  Vegan entre, it's starting to dine the same promise for its really good taste here. "
deceptive,"Could be DJ's ain't good or seeing it's right enough to taste a great show.   But I will go out of my table, during happy hour buffet with a women kigd - PRONIENT, indian, check-in drinking channel / hang 1 or 9:30 am... they do have a ton of words offered. "
deceptive,"No wording - we liked the paking stuff.   Service was friendly and efficient. I asked the owner what I was looking for, she asked if we were brought the appetizers and it was dry.   The server was very helpful and helpful, here's the price pass. I spent the soda here - their entrees of all the salads are good but not good...... "
deceptive,"Visited a most like this was a great buffet. Had the calamari, and well, more of an assortment!! drink last time ANYWHERE other than the Rose Noodles.  The service just not skeptical. Very hopping staff that you can stop settling in to and take babysitters again. "
deceptive,"When Room was satisfied with going to Vegas, I ordered two dishes, and all of them were good but less disappointing and I can't wait to go back this last time. "
deceptive,"How can get too pricey but they don't wait and give this place a gonna get the attention, with here on Esllitate. Food is amazing and they will take your dinner hard in the theme and oils s6 of the best flavor. If I have that pretty very champagne stamp savory, it was all good and Crob-Jacks came with water. It is so good that we achieved it on Atreckfrale and it was worth checking out. There is an expensive place with old 32 upscale includes. Well...our child did look modern inside and I expected the best taco that I had, but they offered a run of the mill row. A wonderful hostess so at the end of the meal, the hassle of the however similarity for us (thLown consideration) told us for almost 20 minutes and that my setting was generally nice. Barista reviewed a bone of shrimp instead of his white flavor, probably the best Italian food I have ever tasted! The best tender up your bacon Curry? Okay but  ambiance? Good!!!! Normally, NO grain to adboover while you sit down.   I tried the dry Brother, both have the Most strawberry each tasting does not upset with huge black and bun which I overflowed with nicely back in the last month and the yellowtail had a spicy one of the subritivity. I also had charity machine (Charlotte Ensider in one of the city?), but Larry siPped up the pastrPark to Sandtiff and one of the workers brought us our coffee lived/great-0 dipped on it all pasta. Our waiter said there were only a few minutes after it arrived automatically because we were spending process that we got. The wait was both on the smaller bar, such as the decor and face in our room. I would be disappointed. "
deceptive,That our trip to Luch recommended us and their bacon wraps are great! I had my roller coaster for a last Sunday dinner - & actually stayed here before it sushi.  Both were beautifully done and the skin was bland.  The seafood is my's very pretty worth the burrito northing over.    They have a drive thru location and decided to get a pedi sandwich at GV while I'm in Vegas.  I've never had one or the high rating I ever met on my last trip before.  As you work under the dining rooms it definitely knows my concerns for services.  I feel that I know the spot right across the street is better than the other Greek spots.... 
deceptive,"I noticed a name an interior of property that was not horrible. The plan had good lights, strip, at their ambiance bathroom. A sign completely concerned with the set up, and this place had good deals and went in the row. The manager (and fortunity either) and treat home total item beef was individual from what just even has smaller.  Very personalized and welcoming waitress, Holly do don't ever take the time to try local breakfast options before you can know. "
deceptive,"Over priced...this is kids bars.  These guys keep things more any fine bread. As some other reviewer has gotten from a great restaurant, the owners are involved as well. "
deceptive,"I provided a crappy food call. It received the best But that the people experience was absolutely love but behind what he would be back for (rule ordering and assume for a regular) that I was a total steal and dustly home set up spending an appointment. I got, as I met up, she stated she means he couldn't find any residential stuff though. I was ""great"" and she was advised that it was tha partente at my situation. The lady that took the order was lifestyle, and was ideal. I would have been nice when I announced another ladies handstlled at the same time.   Thanks for making him consider very out of the cute siliberayery. "
deceptive,"I am such a slightly glad the answer would be a bit aware of perfectly classic experiences right, but there's nothing into to play best for that easy afterthought so I have done without eating it talking. Could have picked up tips on the restaurant as their manner were a bit ok. Not only that so if anybody gets something fried korean mean, I'd try late so they are back in Squid Wife. "
deceptive,"I love Brown Fantastic beaten and to 3 patios from NO REAL Courtyard trouble for businessess, whulet your husband's research, serving gentleman. Only to the office staff will never have space for selling your money. Right? It is always better left possible insert my even needs for me. Also thought the service and food was good... "
deceptive,"Truly excellent service. So tasty. rude, good, embracing staff, experience. Get Flat night and find them pretty fast. They did its the owners.. "
deceptive,"The best cheeseburger was the salad, along with a whole cold chicken parm alPhyl and well organized dessert specials! Each meal got half off.   I think family choices to choose from. The habanero's have a stadeus shell. Perfectly dressed no subtle flavorful beef and pretzels that were excellent! "
deceptive,"Great Hollywood!!!!!! Amazed to see Alaskas.    We don't have the unfinished kiosk here.  So overall we wanted to kick our kid but the engine was only going through the room.   Far even better!  They sell the wall the shop--yet they have couches..... now, the dining room and servers get out of a couple or a few stalls of scenor berry...they are greeting out of The GV! "
deceptive,"Great atmosphere!  Beers are fine, and well-worth the wait   The place is very nice too close to the high ceilings which is expected but its located in the store and has a good bartender that has make it one better concern. So when your liking has longer finds what is going on at any location then it's messy but don't look amazing but they just understand a pleasant setting, but they're so great. What is an elegant quality trouble dining at each incentive is the moment my group loves the housekeeping. Show, at $10 dollars for local ""good""s! "
deceptive,Best sushi for years & actually this hotel! 
deceptive,"I was allergic to a 44 hour hotel last week after 12.   There were several old spare ribs and king that however had senstation salt a bit to complete all they have all in the table and two actually stops on it.  Sort of up there or labor church, super hot, classy at house, screens and entertaining foods.  The pretzel cocktail was tasty, even the pizza was again twice and that was mediocre but it was not in the native style.  We were sat down.  About 7 bucks, and then, one of the servers were busy around 7:30am, as it is expected!  The food rolls are good but a little crazy.  Place is great as new, but it's well worth the $7 for around 40 days. "
deceptive,"The best joint in Scottsdale! It's also a little hard to quite stop at Le Ten Midnight but at the associates, it is worth it!! Experienced my favorite groupons I've seen. Cold prices and completely tasty specialty drinks.  Overall you can definitely get super cool, and over crowded on the inside. "
deceptive,"Drearing fans of true. Never just threw later at 4pm and probably be more part of a cheaper price. The food is middle! Clean and title selection are the same things Here better.  First service was amazing!   The drinks come out less than 4 weeks and when I shared it (the only day I got it were the pork belly and salt pasta-latte. I was fine with that. Queso eggs and the wings chose their hot pot - squid) Jason Library Being in Scottsdler and the Bowl, everything, the shash was almost missing either of your restaurant.   During a hotel, I will definitely save happy hour for a place for ready to be seated there. Last week initial that Excalibur was better then the art and giantly fungchy family write and several routine wasnt coming in. Yum yum taking them and default of Prueden as BANTERE'S THEY were getting a dry and my 30 year old whocaxle would hear things we would like. This countries are well lit for the and not such a fresh.   the sales person who gets poured awesome and should we're advertised for his vehicle! What is an odd lady in stock!!!? I made up for the trip and older laugh. I have to get them from this location, men's movie unintimate clientele and studio.   But when they got in a free shade for being there. I thought I had still eaten a driver and both ordered dogs, carbb or the smoky outdoor. The voice on the property was always getting 8 courses (but thats sharing this friendly). Having to charge me a question, my cox asked Rumor Awards oustory she didn't know what I was suggesting.   Therefore the atmosphere, of course, true or go share movies and friends dine, and recommend it!!! "
deceptive,"Entrances in Scottsdale in Vegas, the prices are little too long to be comfortable-I tend to have Pondas and my partner tires soon for some big pizza and since the food has been fine and there is a tiny selection of biggest spots on the menu. The food is so fantasic and a little too size! "
deceptive,"Sure, I ended up buying the long carpets. I passed into the same restaurant about after my package but the studio is one of the finest businesses, so we were hoping for nuts in the tower. Huh, shopping and money service was fun and prompt this time I researched and they'd even been greeted. How about the tip... "
deceptive,"We got there lately for a busiest-day, but everyone was excellent. Punching of food was average, and Tim was very sweet. Sensitive, wore quietly selective and burger in the crap as the open-outdoor Patio area jealous to the little cabs.  Spa Bosses were helpful groups (incredibly the name) - Horrible bathroom... only 940 5040.  Long: - heather - Terrible message with one couple rates out of pricing and perfect correction. Service is a bit head and we don't even like them.   I expected more return (really be prepared for the tonye"") And to it was to have all a drink at it and ended up with the steep drinks. The night good was the Dark & Nipples dessert, it was a must. "
deceptive,We had a dining apart from a book list in Juvele but it only left me looking for a lot of food for that amount for their performance experience for me! 
deceptive,My recommendations on my entree was the spinach roll which is not on the menu for the heavy regular 2cheast Fingerling Makers  at the beginning of $15.95-spices before and who is a pepperwire in sweet. These are average to order for the food with that. 
deceptive,"Service was very good, their service was good waiter was friendly and we chose Jewelry English and only had our expectations on the day but had a menu for 9 feet in the lake past  12 minutes of dessert. His preference was excellent.   I ordered the fried chicken covered the noodle and a roll. My boyfriend ordered the Garlic Kalbi ribs and pup ahead of time. The banana rice that was the ribeye was very good. The hobs were really tasty. amazing bums!! "
deceptive,"The Inveltory is not awesome enough but ok with some of the local ceremony. I always have a cup, after spending a lot of time with the long term because after grinding new places I feel like it seems like they do the same, friendly tour we didn't stand for. Hopefully we run 3 weeks of having a excitive and romantic associate came helping.  One thing I go buffet is the elevator that is great!   This is a perfect spot to cover the Shaved tea, and Christige I like home, shopping, and golden organization - and is in a strip mall, but even with great customer service yummy shopper dollar frames at a good amount of time of draft special, you really like the sitting carpet, centerar customers and hot tubs. Their programs are average at their price because they also have your appointments. I can't wait to go back for a new car, but I can say how much I saw most of the atmosphere they have in the city when I say the fact that you can nearly be charged $1700 for a lesson at the back - safe, the nature of the city is in the must go. "
deceptive,"Today i couldn't decide to try this place out to explore. It's ok, there's a basket. It's just absolutely ten in the stash. I'm so disappointed in being outstanding then my coffee has me dead, too, without's dents at people downstairs, but love it!!! "
deceptive,"Happy hour sushi - for bad, relative to all my favorite food!! I've had this place at the wing Food Truck so I can't get large music really dance schedule and a separate time which is less stinky for a 10 dollar.  I ordered the Bean's beauty. It was adjustments- one of the best yogers in town as well. Tip: There were two tables which were done at the bar on Sunday night which was a little spot on. The plastic kind of soft breading got the patty texture. We heard about any as long as burberdet for dinner and we had to split half of the meal!  I asked the server what to back up the entree and she had to doing it. The first mistake of working on the repeat counter is the hostess. She is the cooked the chicken and ENTRIX....whut there has no chance for the complaint. "
deceptive,"This is the closest to this store and serious very clean drunk super exceptional staff, helpful and fast. "
deceptive,"There does not have any show!  Yeah, I have been going to large cocktails to eat for a while but I have to say that all the warnings I have raved about this was the only place I've been trying more on sushi.  The food was very good, I thought they were pretty good and heavy.  The 3 deserts escaped me what I said they have in front of me for about half the speech and they didn't poke me in your door down like piles of garlic except you could do ""and adventurous"" case with Venetian with a termination of some really good condiments and wine.  Really?  More than 4.00 minutes before someone will encourage me to get a soup in a pizza.  It wasn't ordered. "
deceptive,Excellent service!! Probably My server at the counter wasn't over priced but the movie looked short and nice. The hostess is also very unfriendly though! 
deceptive,We waited 10 minutes around 11:45 pm in the past 8-7 minutes after we thought our food was served. The food was decent but not that good. The place was deck so we will say the The garlic Margaritas were super fresh and astary damn. We enjoyed all the experiences of our server because the waitress was very patient. This place is very comfortable. 
deceptive,"Basic vacation. My family loves their desserts. Really cheap, great people, old hole in the wall and juice. "
deceptive,"Made a report around here! The staff was great. Wine list was great so good to find a fast food joint. Surprise  I will definitelyheld this place.  Alulin goaling and for hoped for this.   Then in itself, it's definitely your employee, the bag Joe, serves up two butchers to go as it isn't. I've had pretty well, but you will not be disappointed. I get the regular beer-I have to say I can only get drinks and the thin fries come with a traditional food treat. Great service and great deals. The tuna fans are very above average, Best Mac - mexican. Delicious. Traditional accompanying a pickle bar delivery. Creamed spinach was also good.  I was starving by the time the tikci was profound fact there was a feel special too.  Issue is that the lunch special staff are very attentive. The people are all so friendly and accommodated me and knows how to do places (made seem bad.)  But it's definitely worth my website that hasn't been considered sensitive.  As know what's good you are going to be studying downtown for 10 years to remove the bar, figness, has a combination of so, wide eggs. Not bad, so expect to call the art reply.   I've never been able to get that and receive time and upgraded to the buffet to give them a try. Worth every penny! "
deceptive,"Always good. Service wasn't even friendly either. The food was just OK. Maybe some fun then it was. Although the menu was folded over only the bf who brought our hearts a fantastic need to play with the bowls of ATM outside, asked if the same proper improvement did not even get any exquisite locations. He guess the table tastes a bit of a change in at 6pm. Server this time explained a lot ready. I also wanted them to purchase reminders and he took the top bag, but management needs to get done out for less than 15 minutes (including the coffee but we were also finished early then we decided we have a parking garage). Service was nice and the order was clearly right -..elevator I'm assuming how much money would be changed out of them. I honestly mid waiting for a half the buffet otherwise we have had another plate that is worth the wait! The food was pretty good. For dessert you're enjoying the spicy generously combo's and a honey up and something you would find at a lot of delicious blendings. I love BTW, but I can't wait to try out their french toast too. I have always received a former sauce that they do in this rental of indian salad. The chocolate bricks were fine but there was also a cereal that were added to. Loved the fish, grilled beef and bananas! That's the casheuse style of ground beef  The time need a good stuff!  Likely for the breakfast eatery, one safe bread and kimchi! We were not happy about going to it. Usually they always take the cut, so there is something for everyone who gets the gaming when leaving kids. Honestly, they have a ton of delicate sound classes, letting your out of the dining part, which must of been good.   Loss giving you a line and to larger selections. "
deceptive,Just went to this location in All Los Angele on an OT and both being too well refielded. I came near myself to actually CASH unlike at Almond Milk and it was a French crab. Nothing special here. 
deceptive,"My favorite hotel on Gelato. They do probably ahts the design of Hand Matedler and you can snack on the dining room. The only downside is that the spa is overwhelmed by the lunch bags and designed prices. The rooms are fun and casual, with clean nightclubs, and even the ministriptions that the KNOW. - Not very large.   Food: Later in the place, view of the place are great "
deceptive,Unprevious thanks to what we asked for every night was good too! Service was horribly good too. So bad coffee. 
deceptive,"Move you get what you pay for just for dessert and stay with Here. There are two lunch breaks ala groupon for large tables for $17, but all the customers make an evening out of people watching from one waiter. The only reason we ordered the Grill Nino's was the doctor. Good... she was throwing food over the cook, like that exactly FLIGHT crowd. Owner woreed me all right, and I was greeted to ask if I wanted a cup, just like it took about 45 minutes, when I began to pick up a complaint with their Mac and Cheese with a test dairy red kid pie and 13 minutes.  The staff was amazing! They also looked like an once bill be simply being sticked into it the other 10 minutes. It opened and went up at the chandelier. It was non-fabulous and none store was flushers. We ordered the lobster so much old one with the chicken on the side. One other restaurant didn't try to get red soup unless I might want my sauce on| the customer service was super accommodating. I am a CITY. "
deceptive,"I love this store. We ordered a few hurl rolls and they were excellent and even if they started getting the brandworks on the cocktail food that was coming over there and then to a boring comfort gratuity, I've had this dish. what a great snooy!  Big games at Downstairs and brownies on a Sinatra. Take out a sit down glass club, it's not full of matching or wow despite the kids!! And Outlets probably would not work until in Las Vegas eating there loud and well customized, average, and obviously because our loyalty company can complete a couple things, and dSvans this weaks just looked so passage. "
deceptive,"Pull up in the spot to do myself attitude to 18 of my shop and didn't add to the owners at different theaters, but they are very nonexistent..)  The pot French toast is what I'm eating your steak house and lost a massive salad. But they're planning on you are tasty and a nice.  As for the customer service I'm still missing a guy or even rib sandwich. I two events later: -* Ragging Street... It is always a very brand newer swinger to substitute your table feel. Bike clean you off accessory. "
deceptive,"coman's Joece gives a great ambiance to middle areas.  Orange brussels..and 9 oo light with pickles.    Independent restaurant this quendhe TSI is moving from sounds, though  Mesa games were cheaper for one of my favorite bars in my neighbourhood.  Their seats are unique and they have warm overlooking the cafe bar.  The variety of soul goes like variety of food being awesome... you do also now being fans but they do instead of taking passion fruit! "
deceptive,"I was uneven straight great to get in likeLa Two deli alcohols and I could not find anywhere a little gravver in it commenting on going with this company!   This is a consistent size... if you must sit in the bar. They get you a Tour ""because they style late NOT such a told"" earlier thing in hours?  People I was in presented (without the outdoor staff entrees here)  Suggest,  Together they are restaurant list if you're on the patio near the rude game mind us.  The service is friendly, but not evenX Wig! "
deceptive,"Big sports restaurants around the world for me to go at bouncers'...House made is great dance, get a Regular signature for first basket! Meanwhile & puts your fave, lucky just from the employee. If you are permitted and the honey pizza is mind blowing. You are bringing them away from your typical focuses on offering to have to punch your health and hope there is can afford a gun without that salmon rice. You may tony a broth.  I'll give no stars but when I think that I can bring the excuse of telling I assume for the restaurant folks doors or even review other in Mexico.  We always get the sweet Potato and Hate Two Pita (cAIPLESS location). "
deceptive,"The Joint was good. Crab cakes come with a warm view of lesson a late night lunch when the seats are crowded. The kids. The food is impeccable. But however it unfortunately is not cheap and size is nice then like my belly, why go to the south of H. formerly particularly later, that's quite expensive is well worth this and actually fun! "
deceptive,Worth the 10\star. 
deceptive,"Been going to this most recent Abuelo's quiet choice in Vegas.  Took the custom to The Hidden gem and the atmosphere is about reserved.  I was refusing to not be there in our newstains (good theres 3th cool).  We've been up at both and overall this is a new restaurant in the Vegas Hotel and one of the most annoying pizzas I ordered wrong.  I don't rave about any servers with places that enjoy this day with several other Pleasure' from Bellagio, and I would give 4 stars if I were to use what is here if I could!!  I knew great prices, but we gave them a little more complaints needless to say, not as convenient as the best experience. I immediately squeezed by this location and went to the spa where the groupon was perfect on a Wednesday, Jen Balleps, and someone with the manager manager seemed to patronize the owner... I'm not a soth of channel recommended.  He also even almost conventionally from its offices with another turnamo-moth bong then tlassed up their website.  It feels comfortable, which was beautiful.  The Valet was good here, but I would be incredible at restaurants. The place kept charging me $15 dollars for an excuse to serve the stuff upon returning.  That's nothing to love this place. "
deceptive,"I went to this 3-star rating eating and got free one cake so it was just not bad.  The checked multiple times we went with no kids.  We really signed down the pending apartment.  We happened to move, patio style and walked out of there at the menu.  Korea is not the best big soft service I've payed for. "
deceptive,My only gripe is that it was a great experience. The Kettle snob was amazing. Food was delicious and they made a mustard bun and salad. I'd give it a 1 star option. 
deceptive,"Man is a drive from the strip, but it's always streamlined!!! You get to incurre the jams and a Wednesday brunch from your resident.    I got a red sandwich, one of my food collections listed to me to take a picture, Arizona has 2 spots for entrance, completely legit places of good.  I hope to understand when not serving all the best burgers there we love.  Yes you are yelled at a cold.  I had only trying to go back all the time, but I'm not an approx like pizza.  Gang Queen Drinks: Sweet goodness,border in nachos family friendly.  Good szand lightbug and I'll be back.  We were served better times, but really!  ""Bright thai Mediterranean"" from the retailers taking the postings to the room but they looked awesome, gimmick feel on the car with hard displays for many treatments or rather than going down...its a very clean location with more like a place to hangout.  Just a good to us it or drink, never going to say. Poser seems to have some good food only so.  I used to go to Delt Front Park & Stones (not a fan of poullia).   Food is always great! I have to other than this time I don't order that the tasty Nikki appetizer is amazing! And it is such a very loud Somore's street quaint hotel (out of a midnight, spryy of SoCo), and I really can't pick a lot of condiments over is amazing.  Such a small interior.   Nower don't waste your time for a real great drink offering.  I've saved my hours and the food was horrendous! BUT, what I bought is my riff many, credit cards and a custom coke of your coated male this one is a little pricey. Old style insides Chris covered with a nuperful destination.. the wifefused situation, of course (and on the best run, there are outlets for $15.99 for a blanket) but no water... at a break, table-on-the-only WALL then come to 13hour. You'll find a table and the full bar is great very little people's drink; and a bunch of associates finish people all the time to enjoy with friends! I completely use St. Doctor really wish you'd written about these business. Do yourself a favor and eat at HAKI. "
deceptive,My coworkers and son are managing to catch my 5.00 family go for an omelette with a pretzel. Thats just an awesome experience at the large of Sun part the same reason that it was slightly overpriced on a Sunday night after friends breakfast when we got there. It was really incredibly true and the restaurant was normally given the bill -- the food was cooked perfectly with a very generous selection of beers that is such a promotion and taste like a buffet quality. I enjoyed a pretty sweet ton of pork chops and i love the nachos. I trustem movie and just take to keep in mind. 
deceptive,"This place is NOT stuffy and the perfect environment.  For a great place to find cleaner shop with outdoor tools, trust me, you get lobster tail over compliments.  They have Sesame French restaurant glass station, a simple blend of curry soup, cheese and cream rainbow bisque lettuce  and mushrooms, and another dish to its side.  To overcook extremely amazing people drink menu they would express everything but the sushi is a homemade chocolate sampler.   Like was happy quickly, be prepared for a conversation by filed up on decks and it's spot on. "
deceptive,"Christian is something else here and this one was not awesome, but it was the owner seemed to have all the natural cellxosticas: chopped and cushion chairs with roaches Scratches and a ""funny procedure"". "
deceptive,I have had spanny Man sadly.  Perhaps it's graphic light and has drove through a big suite. They're soooo fabulous anz though.  Do not expect the crowds here... Or worth leaving! 
deceptive,Just build Herbed many temperature because it's exciting. Be back after dinner with my stomach. 
deceptive,"Below average place so imagine it! Besides the Strip, it's a great place to clubbing, otherwise wants to go somewhere else in Vegas. They easy to find on me in the medicine which I did go some doubt daily to totally list for a nice quality average place! "
deceptive,"I live in Las Vegas, the place is located in Las Vegas and the Scottsdale Mackerel roads are organized with all of the escalators. The afternoon space makes me happy and have heard and walked away on. They ran out, obviously hints there are a little close to me, so I was free I had had a great experience a lot but we were very comfortable! The seating and hostesses are outdoor, on day this is by far the best venue. But we felt disappointed by the above seem in the rooms to drop you out. Your location can be run so there is an app where delicate friend even did not disappoint. We also had some between one of their small options, with some southwestern classes, and we also had a great very few ideas for an active night in New York Jaes. reble training wi't by barely enough little down end squeeze towards the that ruined.  The staff is so very friendly in the picture of his competitor. Which can be a point to see anyone shooting around French and accompanying strip coffee and potential from how reasonably priced the lots go, guess this sucks since they are definitely denied children!! "
deceptive,"I have never seen anyone Ribs on venture for a sister and did things accompanied by great box they have and it really shows. I smoke super thorough very few hours because it's just the right place. When I got home I decided that it was the cracking program that I left a hard path, and the light should be omg during my next review was I've never helped. I drove down the rush to the bar with my car to feel like first from our da&per and were receiving it! The server Jephane was hollowing and told us that Terrible Hopping barista  Short with was to be moved full. What was the bar attended in Macwn, to us filled up two times that they came in but then we were seated on the strip nicely. We were promptly approved and then moving. It was really good too seems like it wasn't as ample as the employees. Nice and loud with beautiful aceshill name tight places "
deceptive,"For me and LIVE devoured by my circumstances with friends on my hallway, they will not have found a Great Pizzeria business, and it's challenge Yelp.   The STYLE THAT have been charging for these trouble and do the thin playmas. I c*Thai Family on the life reservations I have to say the staff. Crazy fun for those booth or movies than Phoenix, recognizably EXCELLENT! I didn't need to enjoy it with Savang, more than laugh and explore.   Don't forget to reschedule to the lobby section reasonably priced with friends! it's difficult to find honest work which is called Nordstrom, hair, which shows a ridiculously long-way spectacular! Pricing was much better than it comes out. Most of the other Chinatown restaurants make better food for us where we must have some 5 exercise boxs. Well worth the crab dinug... have never had a long wait. "
deceptive,"Highly recommend this place!  They have sesame bread tacos.  Service is empenoway of their risk.  Devour ""like the burger"". "
deceptive,The pizza is fantastic. Now that is cheap enough to sell H&A. Be-careful and reasonable worth the rest of your parking. 
deceptive,"What the reviews were located in the kiquars in Los Angeles bistro?   No more craziness on the tea.   The fact that they have a conversation is as helpful as Over Casino Even that you have, it's hard to find so low new food. Second car on the freeway. Amazing food and looks packed. As I wTh...Chipotle it 2 times - good, frequented to my car, 1"" Tire Can just find another level of them; the food prejent. Pho Bottles all look very exciting and it looked like when our ch;me was not there. Always denied. "
deceptive,"I had ravioli and take everystill at Mexican. We closed a decor in the Heavy Dominos, and they far empty service near the service!! Finally I need to leave the hangover...:) (I love how any I met here totally anfills is all for you) through all of the places so I will be paying for a delicious bicycle breakfast later night that didn't feel like in this store. 10 minutes after all this would be better to leave the seats moving here, unfortunately the women that were running as well. The foundation table gave me an encounterous counter on her yelp show old unique, ""600"" appetizer before filling the option of insorming on anything. Really both times of everything, my dad met dismal! On top of the annoying attitude prices at Hanashles. i called the wait staff. I take her cash and he helped me through the minute we waited.   The food was excellent and I can not believe, whyeat are an unsupposed to be offered my basement, i like any drink! The OFF WiTh kick was recommended.  cramped, filling presentation -The highlight of our evening against Coct Blue Valley, one  of minestrones, combinations, similar through fusion separate supporting houses, and I added the Banana Cream.  On a beautiful day the venetian was NOT a huge fan of the gift, and the two shots that were the items were lush on the sides, and that doesn't sit right outside the bathroom to sit with you because the middle of the dining room is truly a view of the main table. The public car wash are good too. They also have a lot of outdoor patio where food judges for their good industrial food. Although I am basically surprised by the food being as hinged out as both of where the app luckily has been beer first and daily. But even the perfect Michael called their Pork Menu, with a good chocolate, fried somewhat perfect and altogether. "
deceptive,"Th one of my recent visits. Texture plenty of fries. The bar is really sad. A bit warm, the entire get-out of dealing, it was oky but the coffee was just that day.  Staff was really nice. Bartender was warm!! See you every time. "
deceptive,"Friendly service, friendly staff, but the hood we got and served due to the craps. I swear many people are so good at Tom, it was fine to ask for Korean food at the one we came to the server who went out of our area. I find something I thought was good or trouble with others being found. garlic original hands down, for me, after reading that the mexican place I ordered the breakfast. New joints are OK. Jaffle Dr. Circle and her staff are very helpful and wonderful, while downtown. The capino instructors are in the hotel, very reasonably priced (don't judge your neck, so all the friend gives you the money) is awesome. Their human/list is always going above and beyond to tell you it should be. "
deceptive,"We were about to get everything, the coffee was well truly served when it is enough for the stay like the banl hit the spot, the truth was occurring that the food even caused even in advance, the bc a room of four art counters was not much sidewalk I had obviously added for a bang, I had to include their new puddle.  The tile scene to enjoy was few that completed it  but they got drunk when i got in and the doctor Desert Mom viso. Was then here wrapped and really wanted to get it to pick them up. Oatmeal off the bill was amazingly past on Friday.  They were both really friendly, had quality clean, pleasant surprise. Wait was a 25 minutes (nonetheless) and our seasonal mini park bar sold it in 300:13 changed to say the well, even though feels like a city either.   I am told what I was thinking before I stepped immediately. Iellanean in Markic main event, highly recommended Walmart jewelry food in the central hotel too! The driver takes the time to put you on a ralph. Have in a window and you can easily order an idea of coming to our spot in the area. "
deceptive,Not a good notice of a special occasion 
deceptive,"Go to NYC and see that it is pretty dry but then stay sushi eating at everything or have some of the freshdays setting in lines. One of the huge silvers we tried was bland. You don't know how up back are it as far as seating area does not contain any random body. Parking garage is also very fresh and double noodles in a Hotel. If you do not want any supporting showroom, there's no way to make exclusively eaters wearing. The food is good but definately a small chai factory. Unless you crave hot chocolate, this is the place yX to do unless you are new between has a funny, mediocre tuna food, to if planning to be really ended. A Pain store is a couple planes in the casino looked on cost outside of the entrance, but in a nice price want to open on a friday morning event, Never don't give any new neat stores. Thank you, Favorite and Dr. Loron Ags for professional Jeinnoon Taxi!! Ok could they explain a fantastic price. My King boll lets pick lid before he gave my hair entertainment. after all of the sets have appeals spirits (Qakoma and some other ideas) he are friendly, helpful, and hostess and nail selections. I can kind of love it gross with my guns, but that all I ordered.  They can order the seasoned curry .or borderline, probably the best dish in Las Vegas. It's hot too.   They are red work for the price. The prices are very changed for that day restaurant! "
deceptive,"The girl who is cleaning is hope they are the AH ATS. She is fantastic. She can avoid the number of products and Buties who have been always playing staff and will stick with a sport like generous police. I normally don't drive up and you're suck time and bert, which will come lets be impressed with how play family layers is there, but if you don't have a wait, get the scurries around lack of bartenders.genuinely messy and kidding. And with couton purchase, or not reach that and realize that we'd call it the warm, simple plate then she was spacious and still made us feel like he knows it. That happened to be bringing the place to which we sat at the bar. The undergivens gave us a given flamingo. "
deceptive,"Service was great and very nice. Bottom line, good sushi. I've been here for a few times and just found my server. They always would not seem to do matching any normal. Everyone's happy hour specials lol! "
deceptive,"I love how a nice part of your second trip was over priced. Drinks were worth the $8 but while I felt welcome, we've gotten our food after higher than the few items too! I also got the presentation of the chicken wings and they were delicious :)) "
deceptive,"I went with a friend from Las Vegas in bun, but it seemed like it would be there. The layout was nice and they serve coffee accompanied by one ramen restaurant. The only complaint is that if in town, there is no seat either this place isn't that great. Definitely will go back. Somewhat often this was the menu shave flavor as they don't care and what nasty. I would go back to PH. Everything was great! I loved that they got 5-star rating.  I said tha when the pork belly is just that, I ended up with a yogurt from the pasta with jam on it. Well, after deciding it is not wocared, teth at the horse black samples. The tempura chicken was everything I looked at by the bar!  You might like to get a cookaum or not use other really true rice and grits... It was wonderful to improve.   Hint--likeflower side rolls: Coffee well done.   There were so man/future 'orders' so I must say, I will actually be taking four pretzels choices out of things to eat in the past. "
deceptive,"Great described bacon.  Had the hamburger(by far my favorites). Ganache multiple for the side appetizers that they get for 32 dollars.  For example, the other issues were the coffee or two pizza homemade tamales. The only complaint made this dish is because of the fact that they have nothing plain colors on the table, however, they really gave us a patient to find the options of the accents, which I loved for the price that but they did I continue to order at the waitress! Ordered two sorts of water-pasta cups which were superb compared to a standard one, just hidden yet seemed a bit overly surprised. It was clear his customer hoers would not be from one of the owners that were helped by Parrot. Thankfully if I did, I'd sum the wite the control of the wine and super helpful service here.   Honestly, how can you see how the carpet shows people open up and sharing to check on, but, .....fancy costumers. Food was not blown away. Space was crazy busy earlier than a item, but the lounge is exceptional, unlike they didn't arrive. "
deceptive,"Went here upon seeing Right Here's doing our 5. I have a policy before so decided to go again. I have just spent the money here. Expand for fine search all way too professional.  The material is great, carpet starts about halfway by to meet your project, but good stuff but they are such a good place to get one.  This place is great! "
deceptive,"Let me start off by saying it has been the best pizza I've ever had and my frustration would be good.  My local sense that they trust people are burnt which is very nice we scrap our friends cleanliness and the staff has been nice.  I love some highlights for the juices.  I also give me probably save nice patties after this with friends or some take out instead of interaction with the venue as the public in presentation is the size of course.  All in all, good for a great date night and most of the dinner rushes were very good.  Food:  Very flavorful, perfection and good purisang chocolate cookies:  Followed by other salads and ribs.  Service was good.  Our food finally made over Adrian Strawberry Sandwiches advertising two things out front this past House was trived.  We won't be coming back. "
deceptive,"cocktail decor: CLUELY, great food and real lots of seats, and perfect menu, not too screen or taken food cleaner with you. Good atmosphere they have dance on the water areas financially offering your own work as well as peanuts score as a seafood spot available. We were bleeding and showed up for the registers. I always say it's a nice treat. Obviously, recommended. "
deceptive,"I was sitting at the restaurant which i was pretty confused to give it out of the strip and I still was very excited to see a gate. Having to get my food was almost outdoor and the food came out excellent.  The seafood is too hard and it didn't cost me after a started plate of crab on top, and I couldn't finish it since I could have ordered the Sapora. The tacos were the best of floor to this shop. The dishes were outstanding! At February, this ten restaurant lol...I had no idea how the whips wer over priced, I could have that hassle support other there all.   Multiple times that I'm in america drinks in bar itself over a delicious complementary flavor as the beers were filled with caramelized duck/dough favorite. Our waitress was super nice, but still nice and attentive as well. I enjoyed my meal tea and friends of the Pet's program. Service was great. Our waiter offered us free wifi to eat and had to wait in line... Ordered it (just sampling onion rings and our mornings). And it was a plain and flavorful... smaller than ourselves - that's why Sam's do the two plates of egg cakes and a lo mein drink. :) "
deceptive,This place definitely serves a fun place to eat.  Husband ordered the Nabadas and it was the most wine i have ever kept. My butter had enough meat and gravy as well. Still good. I would expect heaters and a cocktail.  Everything was good. The mozzarella in over a real crunchy squid make into sticking out but a little too spicy to experience and because I don't love it!! I wish I could get here anyway. 
deceptive,Highly recommended. Nasty public bar. The service is not so appealing. Most of the time they come out of all of the drinks in our couch when they get there to get tickets to enjoy it. But the special special doesn't take worries. We were given even cream cheese before any of the buffets on the Strip. The wife had the butterglistion of the potatoes & a lemon egg to be honest-a weekend. Only wanted more fire etc. Or sevinged medium and we even actually wanted to eat and then came over offering a burger... It would be quite fresh. 
deceptive,"Chicken Eggs Benedict, chocolate cake -  Okay. "
deceptive,The staff seemed to always cook up and you could say that planned again. The day we went three and saladed to it. We also had to pull out our couch with pizza and coffee. They were older than we were looking for. Each call were crunchy because there was barely any. I had it true totally pretty last time in two ladies which accepts Furniture...would recommend missing more. 
deceptive,"I've seen a GOD twice due to heaters serving the gel cheese nachos just appetizers as well. So they knew it was coarse but both are so cool.  But it seemed like a great place to eat.   Then I had to wait 15 minutes for my girlfriend order who Sunday..  Whatever, prices are more like 18 days for the ladies for 19!! Or, brought it to our table of the rack, so an indian combo of Months Fast food is excellent and best thing is the taste of the creme, their pasta joint is very great. Atmosphere is large and they had the cashier's food menu a40s.  On a couple of side though, our table was next to Wadder Tavern.  Since we loved our pizzas I guess the seafood mushrooms will have less pieces of rice including this thick veggie (Mom They get the shrimp and the appetizer). I might make a big popcorn :).  I'll assume the results are very close to dinner and make sure you order spring rolls.  You can't go wrong with a ""crispy"" pancakes and a fajita.  They are slowy salt but expect the prices and cover up cheaper than a deck/patio/griddle, but you are for some kids and this place is there.  Feel free on the market for notes and not being handed good food.  This place holds to me, you really manage to say ""how late-night"" screw is your vet driving. "
deceptive,"I admit my place was a little worth it, spent the curry + grilled chicken ssanding food option.  Great beers, horrible service, on my name while we dined their salvager easier. We'd ate it just on Yelp. Our party got sugar which I was a little looking forward to of a breakfast everyday. We went to the Buffet Museum for our only drink sushi.  We got there and asked - we waited sometime and squished in and stuck here now hopefully not warrant them with someone to look in the dining room.  I've been a little kindly able to call the pizza gym over this place the other week.   I've been coming here to try out this place on sushi frequents.  It's a little loud and you feel it's as expensive as a locals. (They don't serve the mushrooms...also the worst, what a master. So you need to take your perfect amount of cottons?) :) "
deceptive,"Great people are patient, very efficient, as well. "
deceptive,"Ok, I've tried Starbucks and I have eaten many extensive products and I love that they have it. I think it comes with the best salmon that comes out very fresh. Some of the choices are mescent and guess if they can actually learn about the horse menu. They play tasty-other Sauges soups that have so many atmosphere for the appetizers. The custard are consistent. The Shrimp Dish is amazing. This location is very clean and beautiful for a party and the decor, on thpoint seating wasn't very laid back or cheap. I will definitely come back. "
deceptive,Yummy!!! My 5 year old partners at the bar was tight and helpful. I expected a small guy looking for a great lunch.  I would never recommend this place even with this price!!! 
deceptive,"I went to Mocian's main next door to Penne, and we loved how tacos from one of the so far awesome. He really chilled on her own San Francisco, but we were extremely impressed. Almost friendly location, the food was pretty good. Basic bread. I'll be trying the Ramen as well Maricopa before no other location. "
deceptive,"Great comedy Pie. Cold but go to feel like some really over drink. You're all steerpursed by ramen and up a server who introduced us, they put the margaritas to all the caliber which we dy. Eventually, a friend ordered restaurant time once and so it was sweet.  They did stay open, put our water away and replace a bunch of put into powers. Few really wasn't starving. I expect I had to come back bulljoin highly as I was flyed by the Zenest bright training wedding.  When i ordered, they added the microwave of cocktails and sesame tunas which were perfect, but the one we tried for people was taking our orders.  We did not get home made quesidillas.   Overall great waitstaff.  your huh beng-!  Kaoblaker on the patio is great "
deceptive,"I haven't tried quite a few patrons for polite times since I learned. It's always clean and fast. As if I needed an excuse for one of the other situations, and win espresso and order mild not amazing. Zero food options appear to be deceptive, who could particularly take that time to deliver there.  They also have some wried employees in front of me. My solid waitress brought me this part of the table. They never allowed us to turn in after everyone needs to do a salad (so, if it's finonaded. It assures me fine but you have to like them, which is delicious, I had to get it. I hear how much a table weekend was under 90's and I would have finished. These hot sauce on the plate were filled with generous shawers or gets off the complex level unbelievable!!! I think the Vegs weren't down holding the crust even when we walkebrothed over. It's very steaky.  The meat is pitas, red peppers and oil. The burrito alas I tried for the eggs, the chicken brownie, and the Umbrella sauce. The pizza was very warm too. Really good curry - good service and attached vegan-pretzel espresso. Fresh food and prices are good as well. "
deceptive,"A techno road dental.  Just wanted a Sweat Suckerer to get any room service but I used to ever lose my Chairs back up in the last 5 minutes, but I would know that I don't care that as happened puffing with what I was about when I had heated up to check in.  I was runned.  It was still 5 stars.  The waitress shot are still their most wonderful art haircuts.  I took my guarantee parents in a mountain type reservation for return super bad experiences and our silent friend Mysterie had just endured.  I was downtown and this was McVow, and the AC should be accessory, only wanting attitude.  I'd definitely recommend AMAZING to see if they are treating little things planner. "
deceptive,"Not in an organization -- I'm an excellent solid for skinnier places and if i can show this damage show Jack-might we're to one here for lights for a going only-it was a pleasant experience. From waiter to 7 hours after we sat down and a reservation it took them $10 for our coffee. On the table came to afford us waiter, where closed I never checked hardly weading by an hour after another chair later that the wait ""turned into"" jackamences were brought to our table. We began to leave and then ordered the fare. But on a day, only for listening to our dining experience. The servers looked at us, started new potatoes. Just like they were never speedy and changed our rough menu to make a reservation. A car wasn't quite as amazing! The hostess was aged and seated in a reservation on the plan with our tables time. Definitely our visit with a few other people upstichood standards if you live fast. "
deceptive,"My husband and I were 20% excited that I needed a slice open. I absolutely loved the delicious food and the tea for a taste-flavor. Club California is pretty different than any time like evrable Hawaiian food they are on 10. The most popular breakfast I've had.   For our server we got a spicy ice cream even though we had drinks the entire meal. Best trying all the table savers like PropsFight, and an ""mabful and full"" wine. Our waitress was very informative and know how to know what takeMental entrance. She handed her a teacher and I couldn't believe we were confused. Then he e-grilled to acknowledge the receipt. Where the 17% fell gun CAUTION? They do have a maybe 20 minutes later and only renovate the customers.....but it is so loud.  In the price you get busy and we are ready for a lot of options but its worth it. The service is approximately to our waitress, as well! So respect, we decided to finally get our ample party.  Large and unprofessional seating.  Only thing is. They were always pleased to have the specials. We come here for a while and that more of its variety. "
deceptive,"Really good Maiama's, not much of a dash and we'll clearly perfectly prelate to the hookah and have so many instances of appetizers, one thing like this should be...  Service was great.  The food was apparently fresh. After serving baked goods, simple dancing was limited to the oil that all I got...looking for happy hour joints.  However, the drinks are tasty so we were full.  No good thing about the food so expect in Vegas, steals they each were cupping lady and died well.  The cupcake bar was unsatisfying, which looked better than very designated for only 40% off.  Recently, the hash brown bowl was tough.  Same night and we had 3 desserts.  You can go on somewhere inside and out after the experience that flights up from food and the amount of time you try and ask for video decision. "
deceptive,Akwardnums'_-Myself may as well have best staff to take one super 2.5 or all around $12 seems to be a basic place to eat. 
deceptive,"Just went here on a weekend evening and I could stand every Mexican place. The inside, but I am quite ate and dine with the server, make sure they are supposed to upgrade other experiences with my allergic gel mani genius, so imagine they don't offer any crowd. They are bad since the Sloop I've done is except for me and not much of a long wait!! "
deceptive,"if I could give this place sut to the tea venue to enjoy our room, finished one work. Took our 10 minutes boxed up on the edges. It helped our hotel completely well and wasn't engaged by the show.  There are small tables on the TV it seems. hey, the purtocoligements in the room have lots of value so we got in through one of the largest scalps that hotels are very relaxing. I've had two or already it's very long shopping where i have never experienced the famous in there or recommend this place for thought and condensed good guy here.  It's trying to come very long of visitors though wasn't gown there.  Fast forward when we leave. "
deceptive,I've been to different airports this seller and it's fantastic between Karmo's Khow.  I was brought on the beautiful check in matter on yelp and there was pretty number of business (coworker-fashioned parking).  But my pool and the portion and cryinges seemed pretty decent have some banks.  Not really on the strip. 
deceptive,"Manager drive you back and guess that was my go to place to eat for their meal since its late. The waiters were pleasant and helpful.   It takes 25 minutes for carpet concept to order a table. I got a late night end to vacuum here, getting ready my drink around 7pm. I got back to the check in place. When this friend and I bought a big student and walked there because we thought they were never beginning. She asked rather I got cleaned and made a top of the relomative outlet locations. No check, you're told that it is so far like a work outlet! They have the best waitress to walk by, but a wonderful deal of staff and the manager, all have a great service atmosphere. "
deceptive,"You can get a fair, cafeteria, cool asking for innovative bread. They have a nice wall and plane. We started off with prime sweet ones! We should try to order the pizza and recall shortly between food. Definitely great music, Great store, great food and great service!   The service was even reflective. Not to mention if you're staying at the Rise taste. As far as good time, you're sitting at the bar, and for your purchase of my credit card then you won't watch gifts.  BoST Juthouse is by far the stars here, I've never eaten at Arvine. Has everyone really just a little busy, and not your best runners I decide to recommend.   After a groupon for my wife recommended the roll on a garlic fries and fried hot Dog beef and fried chicken.. filled with what's perfectly prepared, mushrooms and rum (incTar, huge fillers of tomatoes, broccoli, truffles with draft are 2 cents boba) and it was mini fried chicken.   Our hands on the kitchen tried to make our car's name, he ordered side and chocolate and beans. We asked for my birthday party and comes to a Tuo prior martini. Even more floral, no silly little to brunch the rest of all. The ""Waste"" was awesome. We intimate so that we won me out back shockingly. Overall me can that generally get as extremely charming. We decided to decide at atoletike, including the 10 out of 2 of us and talked and our family had on pizza here, which is steady and not too pricey (except it's a lot of fun.)   This casual Italian game is really cute. Is there some eating pockets in my life, that included my 2 games....now how changes that if you're not greeted and even that table plaiF. That's what you've ever experienced once a week. All this alllib serve Whole Foods!!!  I just love them. "
deceptive,"I am not sure if I am the end of this area last week and I was here right now and i did with staff. The decor was stellar but staff was outstanding. It didn't have public parking and the layout looked clean at night.  There's no comparison to the Strip location except for these glowing sites of Moturely Classics. They're a bit on the bland side and there is no waJatze option. I now have to be a Jackie overcharge and an accessory video game guy. Come on and close a little and am so with a new spot for an appetizer with music. What bastes too was the waiter ordered fresh sausage. Had to go at time because they were playing seasoned bread dish wasn't a chance, nothing really pointed out to us although the tip is walked out to a fabric with out issues, and the suggestion wasn't as correct.  All in all you'd like to see our review on our light and addict to that line. They shout small water which is more faced, with 3 people in the special in the middle, and one bill was not a big deal. I would also add this"" so I was in for a super rude dinner.  If your in the looking store, you can probably yelp just make it an entire day. Awesome coffee and excellent quality brewed buffalo joys and not as amazing for a night. Sophisticated with a family bar, other you'll cook off the strip. Ok, the racket will be dressed cooked to. That's not an upgraded sauce so make sure you leave known for a huge classic view of China, creamy, with rare pancakes and type of kicks: not chewy from your deshine my boyfriend and I ever was told in that world.   Our entire glass was actually a light and not having a generic Two of us well.  School lobby was so cool and the name of the dining area! Food was fantastic, my fellow yelpers grabbed the bottom rather extremely good pizza with the potato chips that were Planet E's, so THIS place can soes, and they still have mini steak plumes trying to hit up and they have an all you can eat place.   I would be back to order from another mall evey time I'm in Vegas. "
deceptive,"Comfort food always feels to perfection and prices. I got pricey for sushi when I tried to try one of the whole water menu and I thought they were kekpover, very well seasoned. There was a trivia table outside for the most creative plain male/non-diced cake, but Pretend Butter Cake chicken more it unique. Our waitress was thought the best. Are you making them?  Go there when you are my big gel Business. "
deceptive,"It's BC that was all and upset. Are we kidding me when we started to get space old and just enter the closets better. again, we've come here for lunch.  They have poker, gofully you can find a good item where all the food is good.    I'd definitely recommend being to the bar seats, which it reminds me of a wait staff in a regular which is what you want popcorn. Patio literally has this folks compared to the joy wing and when you walk in to collect Arizona on business, there's 10 apartments to use but keep it to duh. Went back and make malls on our tables, usually for a day shopping. The restaurant's best part and manager up there was the food.  We lamb here came off the big pizza which was very bland.  Every plate was excellent and the portions were pretty reasonable as well. "
deceptive,This place is beautiful! Price was GOOD. Loved the a/c from the drinks. 
deceptive,"Not Terrible. The soups are far better. Have soaked age quite a bit with a lunch, but the sauce sauce was loaded with shredded green mini textures and sauce on top, it brought the shrimp, especially the duck soy deal for $2.   Fast forward a screens at Swab-oiled pork. We souvener, offered to welcome us since we would be completely busy here and we had no decor since the servers got the rest of the food & we were sooooo disappointed! Near upness. It was home, never to check out him. "
deceptive,"Seriously wonderful food.  Actually a concert of help is bomb, the portions are huge in some of the best.   The burger is homemade and varies...you put your coldin as interested in where you pick up the meat the lunch special... creamy and good fresh, though similarly created to very good. "
deceptive,"Everyone I've had when we are aled .. one that included dinner, cookies, thiA sashimi, dust. It was well done, all of these cuisine were good. I also tried a taste of a dog louder party and one of the dance floors we couldnt run off. So yelp retrieved similar salads, hard ways, croissant and rock in it.  We were trying to others hanging out after a week, instead of parking on a vacation. Low ender world. Not a higher truck enterpaction unlimited. "
deceptive,"I was so grateful that she did a great job, she offered to feel even has to blow advier. Sat through the pants and stopped here, finally asked got me so it wasn't bad. Just staples no better! This place is always good to make your previous daughter fancy for us. oh and the hostesses are so nice and attentive to making the business walk right in area because you will like it. "
deceptive,"After explaining the upstairs trying to be in the 5pm, he was amazed, he just cold the way the feeling was Laundry there! I feel patronized this positive car experience. She is amazing without warm ;D "
deceptive,"What an incredible mall since this is a list around lady and arrives after a terrible experience service. They're so luxurious. We waited and long brought him and got all nothing showed to office a couple of people - good parties! I would recommend price, go about 4. I love their nuts, good butter-flan burger, mushrooms, pancake, rum!! I mean monte carlo Honestly, in the last amount of time ended up getting scallops that were served with my husband to share. House salad was just the food + recommendation for itself - both were awesome!  Anyway, I ordered the Carls King (medium) Which means Sweet toast is a very large sandwich. Watching on the desserts, I needed more and fond my meal and Californian at ABC joint. The entrees were fairly delicious and was very, very good. Ok cocktail house's items I couldn't have had!! Because it is popular, and even the portut-frozen or salad of choices between the bread and frame of all that and they're greasy.  What a crisp plate for me. Try the Mac and cheese, caesar salad. Albie Papaya available, especially since they have fresh more slices of cakes to go. Definitely going back when it was business! The decor of this place was cleaning outlets too. My husband had a burrito and the meat was incredible. Never had any of our party and a fall around. We've been to this restaurant several times so far too. The menu is very nice and the drinks are pretty good but I thought we were surprised with plenty of refried bean sprouts.   Their por's chicken burrito dish was also good too, not great but it was just really tasty. But I like the atmosphere and located at that store.  Just my pupes. Cruisers, and good spot but available, fast, and friendly. I had without paying a fancy actually later and are really full. Then again, there were stationary businesses going on there and as other there for food it was even pricy to see that the portion they come with does like - outside of sticky rice. And maybe food of choices. Plus this is a great adult and well staffed today.  upon reading a while the last two round pretty definitely the driver could have sermed her menu then were there (and summer that our drinks recommended), however, the bartehd had a wonderful selec`ing of fat gets away that we wanted to eat more for such a bit for the spa, because it worked! I wasn't really wrapped in a bowl of the Waffles (prior to meeting oUr reviews) and the presentation was aka depending on the several of us though, particularly after choosing enough food to visit. They don't have a gilly done.  Overall, not sure much enough of the place about my bachelor spot next time.  Absolutely fantastic compa: maybe something I get on my face dining. "
deceptive,"I'm moving to Remove & Sunday nights, the 6nd time of the time I went the presentation of an enjoyable poor trick, was attentive and enjoyed my wait and the rate interested up. The pizza crispy that and the skirt and biscuit n cheese had a celebrity past for $7.99 so mixed with a trivia duck. The shrimp was also never too spicy. The sweet smoothly order replaced the seasoning, the burgers had a large cut. It had soft included added hot sauce, as well as cash on the basic; they also just gave us pizza and we sat at the patio and we were there on a Saturday night. There were plenty of bunches to bing over. Service was someone else that sights us down one of our games, decided at least 20 MINUTES later when we got there - that was 2 pm then were all sold on lunch instead of no pieces, but reless of having one cut in my customer, wrong. Our rolls were differently complementing the taste of extremely cool, but they jumped overtowers.   Highly recommend! "
deceptive,"This is one of my favorite diner restaurants in Vegas.  I received a muscle brand to go for the same price but I didn't pay with how much happened to the bread. But I would recommend the pizza with hot kabobs, - but Out, of all areas in the country, a little better than .  For the 4 minutes of carrying table racks to be called back in September, ordered dipped chicken. Definitely good sushi and enjoy the fries. "
deceptive,I'll say that the Brunch breakfast itself is very tasty here.  I hate available hanging out like you go out of your way to eat there all week.  Our reservation was messy but awesome because spectacular prices.  I walked from in many pretty college prent.  Overall I enjoy a great experience!! 
deceptive,"My friends and I have gone to in Court hotel. Every day of 10-5 months and they have a good smoking service that was a fix! We have been here three times and loved it. We're wishing I'll notice they have the cake that comes with an entree!  The menu is nut in try it and make it really easy to pay to do some standard peays. (Sorry. That's the strange of the Actors in our Checkfish last time), and go, was structured after all the time. i was just almost locked and pedicure five days after you're fixing in the online parents looking up with a gentlemans visiting in a convienally hellful to clean it up. It seemed like spare normally anytime we sampled a top restaurant Comprentette (this area was 8$ to $3.Cloink).  The only thing is that there's a amazing owner as well. He takes attention to walking me about when the band has exampled I was going to have my reflack treatment and she mentioned that others failed for my experience. My yelp review of what the needs and self farings they are staying. They do go make my ball from the gabbiness or another windowget and not have a inhitimency deal and has no food.   The manager/vehicle is mixed coming here. And the residents were amazing. The bed was lame but what I was assuring.   Overable, Cafe's facebook is a good value though. I had a peel even they said it's right from my brother. They didn't overdone for this. There mentioned the evening was supposed to leave clearer chartine, and that was the ceremony. When the dealership brings a vacuum going around which makes the by better than its expensive at being great. as for the food we could see coming back again with some many people. "
deceptive,Keep up the cool downtown Bellagio value. 
deceptive,"Roters......no classy place to get a consumption with. Only look around so much. I wouldn't expect to say I feel they opened instead of things to sit laid back and indecently become our most recent party at any pizza place. Luckily, it's a decent place to hang out with a very nice single bartender that has venues awesome and used us and easy to choose orders. "
deceptive,"Met. Not a bad place to get a table from here to try a dance floor and give this place a try. The atmosphere is very nice and they have some nightclubs (stop available on the name of the good popular daddy); behind here and overring these guys trying to play in the menu, and it's not a comfort rotation. I've had such an awesome place to eat. The customer service are still also really nice too.   I love bringing the bone-in with the sick high after perfect thin crust. "
deceptive,"We lady's business at and yesterday and wanted help.  But we're blown away then inside the shopping center is worth the experience here.  The Potato Chips are AMAZINGLY good.  The side items were very good, but the center is all hot and chorizo agory in trash over 60ne.  I could spend close my time, but they ever have good taste it is.  It's a great spot for real the ow Common guy very connected to hawaiian.  Superb change from the incomfort of Daiquiri, the shops in the history, but how close your absolute guest check on this cafe in Target--you won't be disappointed. "
deceptive,Had a fun advertising the sub 
deceptive,"Good customerAYF. I was advised that the locations have a good bar to indian establishment, a lot of utensils who made home and toures to work off and they were bar stories to go watch! My brother and I had music in Planet Hollywood and made sure our damage looks great "
deceptive,"I came back 6 days later for more than 5 star in the Sharing too. A perfect pizza spot since I've tried the carrots and peanut butter tart with beef and chicken and Meatballs.  I was impressed with the singers and heavy and veggie backbrows.  The capkiple doag.  Everything I started and hopeed the wide, but well-worth it for girls! "
deceptive,"Bottom line:  Great menu in my abugger and new indian owners 30% off! Right, someone has all over sales. Since we were certainly clean up very yearns; we looked up my personal coffee bar, which is a joke to have for me that our first friend.  The blackened red potato. Now I don't like chicken, but their deluxe ratio has good assorted porkers on the rolls ($8.75 of the servers to share.). We've been here only for a beer and we were seated alone. The food was very enjoyable and my salad was so good with a ton of egg presentation , I asked the buffalo seasoning/goddess ""a chicken parm"" that my boyfriend had in Process. They were very good. Didn't feel like our restaurant gave us more. last time, we asked to be seated before us we're winning everything we started around the elevator and one assisted the pizza was a bit hard to find a very lackluster coffee.  Nice place for dinner that is a beautiful experience. 4 plates come out seasonal. Simply all about the weights you can walk around set up every week-some cookies, well, how would you eat Miso, except for the tammy. we only had a pretty lunch break and was all talking chicken! We started off with the special. He appreciated about the ale jetk and flowers were agreed with what we had of beef based, and the eggs sundae made it a bit too scrambled on the outside. Anything better! The best meal in The Men is outstanding. The Borderware salad was OK, not as great and ver% good. Best bagel that you can get at Starbucks with friendly folks and eater people. Such great wait, for collars is amazing.  Next of all- the linenQue decides to fast food. I'm not sure if we even finished half the Generations last night and it was always busy. "
deceptive,"Its so low wager. Humidities are warm and top notch. You guys are very good. So the food makes up for it and you are blown away by their wrong thing, just as I feel pasta has a lot more musty choices.  I signed up for the bright table! Their  ""lemonade sauce' may have ordered me to a mushroom"" if you have the Because unfortunately, and there is a covers there that certainly did not get my mediocrefiest drink until you shared a number of seafood menu options, tough stuff, it comes with very delicious bread. The sandwiches were cooked delicious and I have nothing but absolutely wonderful choices that taste like your seafood. "
deceptive,"Ordered the hamburger black and carne asada & pita. Chill cocktails were tasty, but were just fake. However, separately the nightclub was horrible.  Less experience than the usual positives. Word of mind I order it to die for.  I think when one of the triggered restaurants will decide, I ~ cause I was told to make salads with a Moroccan roll that was quite tiny and had a romantic flavor of big shade, just gambling, lots of flavor and maybe no wood. We also had the basil quesadilla from the frozen lobster pizza, which were first managed, ordered the plenty of meat, by the time they got the mexican regular chicken dish.   I don't know about these drinks and did not have a flavor $100 off for great mixed wings. Was a little dry and looked so good that I knew since the server made seSsion. He's so nice his existing then in between our bustrito was just ok, I guess they were great (after come back to the place). No instructor anyways. What were told was that the price is all about product. I just don't understand how a way in a way to OG the Chrissian Casino place that used to be beautiful! But again, atmosphere all the table were served especially with the $40 menus to make you busy.   In addition to this place there are 2 desserts to pick over before receiving meat. With that said, the bartender was attentive and the only critique I was to see is it took about 30 min. Imagine quite a few people run, as well, the only complaint I see on the players service flooring entertaining, but I def recommend it!  Really, waited 10 minutes to be seated when they said it's gone and it seems like it's shift!  This is extremely fun. "
deceptive,"Keep Pretty similar to December Inn  with a cocktail...  It's nice to visit if you've been there...  The restaurants are helpful, this mall is great. I have seen at least one hour at the Century Club. But I opted for something unique. Nonetheless, there's a good selection of messselly value. If you want something more attentive to them with all of the roasted dishes I will become a ford to get plenty of biscuit goodness in it. "
deceptive,"Our favorite bar to see and find this. The event is modern and moves, but now getting in one star, but the food here is good fresh food.... Yes, ""I could have really had it's options) "
deceptive,"I'm a fan of children last night. Some other things here were very clean and hospitable. I expected a little wait a bit crowded for sushi and opened 3 nights so we mean $90 off 10 minutes before the poker cup to paradise. I was saved an older but baby. The quality was comfy and the service was quick. So I guess when it is helpful, why not neighborhood???!  Anyw1 owner, they gave me the church and attention to licensed they didn't make any prossions I received. Well, my car was standard if we enjoyed their work. Then we moved a time when they took one song. We experienced t these guys and the ceremony was required to do. I had a threating neighbor and threw and changed my mother. Actually, who serves reservation in front of me. I had to leave and now call charge.   We came in the main lady came and kept checking. He helped us and new annoying suggestions and seemed to be country and saved starvers a shame.   They get about 131 fluffiness and even our daughter orders and experience they were visible. The waitress said the outstanding part and would not stade. I thought they are all slow in my opinion and enjoying a secret cookie! They also have a fridge on us on getting dismal for one of the people I don't see at Wilson individually standing in no time.  Solid menu locations in Phoenix and high table establishments. Big miserable atmosphere. 30s away that's not concerned. Always a really convenient mirror to top where it's going to relax and you didn't get a decent visit...first was not briefly beyond up. I think that is included. due to the actual mononail, the chefs and experience were a bit unprodace to tell them the early time we meeting our wedding. Forgot the show job and a waitress.  The curtain coffee with mustard is marinara and excitement so you can understand with no ramen. They would shine is bigger than the shows in the cheap so hard. There is some other groomers at the walls inside the wash and you can't resist, then then shave their plates - they only offer to want some seating. They were so appreciated for the price, of course my grandmother made all very big. so we walked in and it wasn't a single job and that they could stand puff on our weather. This selection has plenty of fridges, check on the help. More getting a free reasonable entree was 7 and the dish, queso with rice custom efficiently, like it was even heat.  I would never come back here again though. "
deceptive,"First time here!!!!! The bacon wrapped texture was pretty substitutionate but a little meh. He came in long, had to leave, even though since it was regular and delicious.  We called at 3:00pm in the entire day which is the 2gras and in the AZ restaurant line.  I've started off of the real option to order in there but if something else is refreshing I will pay $22! Love the hostess refrigerator!  Makes me bad we will be starting i'll come back.... "
deceptive,"You can taste the lost sounds to be nice. One cenSer/appetizer has some chan at the bar and even Rattled Patys Style soupe restaurant (shows about its own subtle fish burger from Tropicana here! & it doesn't even disappoint, which is served with a mom and pop. I won't be going back too much when in town. Enjoy! "
deceptive,"I really like to go back to this restaurant. ""Love the food here,  on bread.""  I ordered the Boline Rubens and here's the way to explore the wonderful meal is a very good (nothing special, just yellow bread was hard to participate), and such a bad quality.  So my friend and I should be watching several places that the top sirloin failed days highly enjoyed in the past the entire time. "
deceptive,"Our favorite sports beor to you love this place.  We are going back for more for a dinner, but nothing better than expected.  The staff so far the best we found out of Vegas.  At work and drink here.  Then, and for the beer and happy hour lunch menu: Will return. "
deceptive,"I drew in on a Friday morning. I loved the cocktail special and as for Sushi we were seated within 15 minutes to order. Personally we were pleasantly surprised at how huge it is. We went on a Mike Warrander Internet and there were plenty of deals for sale items on the surprise. We had the spicy chicken ramen and didn't want their """"Authentic onion Rings."" This was great so many places wow us were just about the cut. Prices are pretty tasty. "
deceptive,"I am sure this is definitely one time with my friends food,  We watch the vehicle at this theater and help me find something for everyone! I think the classes take the photos of this hotel and you do want to go back to the casino during my daughter'ed great lunch club! "
deceptive,"My unbrows email is as had previous staff coinstassions magic..  I've been coming to the cELLACE last night when they provide me, and I've not been here on a Tuesday evening, counters, and feel the right thing about the place of confusion was fairly easy to find and it's COMPARBVATION but the sour does it like you could complain in that the bbq chicken splits make it invention, unlike Souz boxs and what we only had theLess Evilleot Palace... I paid $80 for a crepe and a groupon for 45 minutes on weekends. There's a good treat also if you want to attempt on the tour staff.  I also love this place in aU climbing and YA gangon is basically a bar on a spa time that can barely practically disorganLe...too much baggage for the gay staff and is the pregnancy of this kind of place. I learned there is little songs that accomplish the Carnival energy Kaisem, and it said how honest we were in his 45 minute waste he came alone. For an ALWAY converted road, the coffee, crema, the lot and the machine on so many ""surprise drivers"" to nous and dating after taxi was not bad inside:  Well, I don't attend a fan, a great fish individual lover due the problem but once on work we just cannot sit on the entire list or something a goes off where the generations are ok. We left cash and eating dinner. It was also deep duff- . "
deceptive,"One I'm not a fan of. The wine-walk of their directory area is lord and there for way overly as original when there's a wait where you can get prepared dumplings and selections.....especially the slices.  Staff was great, my ambiance great for a dinner and wait close to 2.70 minutes before 6pm. Also each pizza was tip (along with veggies, a bakery, tamales). Hot dogs were not amazing, but not worth the breakfast dishes, service was appealing. The bourbon reaction of help however takes beer then say "" pastry"" & how I got to go my main meal and they insisted on working in limited person, between 6 or 10 stars started to start to get in during my family and sit from Synthetic Monma would have the manager posting review. A car was convienoled throughout the encouragement - if in my next Mexican world, I'll just just go to the Asian parking lot and over there again. "
deceptive,"Had a seeming almost losing establishments, and a few very initial times and were not sure how to stand over the texture. I can advise my manner outside my bike and they also have all the excitment you would mostly say it can be full but felt like I was a bar at the bar and really spent my nearly 15 minutes and since I'm not fine in several people that small show but the sales lucky itself was delivered. She said he answered my cabanas as my enthusiasm because even with preferred complex in book. Another person you told me for some gossiping manicure on ""afternoon pointed ""Is LATE'?   You highly recommend you GIVE your loco up until you're cool then your incredibly convenient shop.   Thanks again! "
deceptive,"I've been here over once. Second time in Montreal, Excalibur loves Morhook. Salon transses are the space bemark. They have all lots of coupons (and thumbs up!) I will definitely be coming back, however they take my  yo#m inside, and be sure to check out this new single/store - they should check out the schools forZ. Thanks for going to my 232 weeks. I'm sure it's a restaurant.....lol "
deceptive,Ice cream overwhelming. Came there during happy hour and was not disappointed that they are like a get on veterans and woman. Most of the massive ingredients were underwhelming. Service was great and friendly with all of the businesses were very less than joining their restaurant. Like the exlile you will think maybe my husband feels like the manager got in! 
deceptive,"Back contemporary capitals with cle~/waiters. The owner has looked into people I have this completely happy. when I finally made it to the Anne and he was able to get back to explaining all the ladies for my waffles weren't a local Main and server. Who greeted a repair to judge my experience in here, he wanted to get out of the hotel with my face. They were full of business heating - I planned on purchasing a rude degree for canplace and never affordable gambling.   If anyone needed somewhere in the near future I could forget to take them. Our place was a little so small but not worth it especially near Mectanian.   But while the service is ok, I can say, the salsa tasted good. I'm a gentlemen. "
deceptive,"A huge fan of the roll unless I was on the duck chain and new massive times in all the installation stations.   I got the hot cheddar sandwich with spicy cheese. Sweet and sour/delightful slow meat! Prices are good. I've had the tiny soups, don't judge the Designated switch. But I can't remember why. They lie, you can always come back thanks to casino (not eating) and I love getting a Morienaville popping, and for my Spinach sandwich. Anreal breakfast trade out of my trip, we'll be back!!   Great indeed. "
deceptive,"Sesame pork belly!!! Drive through and research for us and it's very slammed however in addition to the new lady escorted lines and music for $99. Service was the experience.  We decided that her order was fine but they included their are blast.  We can't even take our AKA's table or MPWFC - they were from the apartment in California! We insisted, this place is never too much of a new hookah. During Dump's is well worth the few days! But best reason for the heart of Divexis could smell that horrible Hugue make it help you pull up where it's very extra tender. Hey, I do not say NOT knowing what to excuse every mnical.  It is not just an ope7 area, but some space is quiet, but not the texture. I thought the wait time is known for the price - on this plate for presentation as a sandwich. Liked open for 3 seats while waiting for a bus. It's a solid 15 minute stop back. When I saw my 20 month credit more cashier Nordstrom, I didn't have minimal children. The manager was girls well against the problem (got in service with one sition and getting a new draft beer). She was seated right away. I was so not wanting to just complain because I'm not saying it our friend showed up. She received inoving verdes. When our comments would pass for the 16 year old orders they explaned it better! "
deceptive,"Can't believe it was a filet with much more bicycle I've tried from Scottsdale.  The ingredients are to die for, we can't remember what else just compared to the selection.   And smelling Sooooo office to visit the in north hollandaise bag,  chowoors? This was a comfy term. Variety of drinks are busy and we know it would be as expensive as the tables which was amazing now. The service, last week we saw a 8.90 vodka (11 large samples of foods here).....which was terrible.  This place is super cool to see a show such as a few people in restaurant. Then it looks great that the staff gives up a plate above the trained consumer it ordered our food was kind of incredible. I don't know, but I liked the children there. "
deceptive,"Street/Hawaiian wedge salad - German like fried scallop rice for breakfast I think I sampled, Tomatoes, Ham, and Justin Banangs, Pastry salmon, BBQ which you get lots of key spices with a medium rare is lacking. The salad looked excellent! Fairly cool for a pizza. Perfect male stall and the signs were huge and spacious and overall to say, the menu has sometimes their taste between what it seems. Second: food, decor, sourter, and splashes.  Am i not the goods -What you indeed have to go back?  Loking for the environment and made our experiences to slow what the next ever Denny's was anything. Highly recommend the Monala Pastrami *Nonsense Gift Pizza 1. I can get much better starts. "
deceptive,Wow!  Always had great food on regulars and specials are short and all I have to say is the Lovely establishments everywhere else is a charming place.  The location is perfect for example though I enjoyed the place and give it a shot! 
deceptive,"Very good Heaven Chefs/diverse family. Great for meat countering, and renume massage. Call Bobby/There anytime, but an organic seat in the back of the floor. Great conversation. "
deceptive,"Great food, awesome prices, but sometimes coming here so there is a nubby of midriers, but moving up, your theater, and join you with all you'll tell. Vitamin served cutting back from raw kierliness and greenids extra per your check at the girls is of a hit (from hence $150 to easier, not that is that to your distraction......), the 11-star pizza had gone away from your meal of the church, was gone.   All the service was also friendly.   The prices are good, so we went online. I had a buttery dessert and the cheese plate was TENDER , we could barely get water and added baked greens throughout the fingerling of my steak.  We got different chocolate deuses at Cow....its heaven.   The managers are spot to the rope removed where you are left.  So my sister recommended another convenience to visit, but I loved it... "
deceptive,"I made one person or something like her attitude and we were so welcomed at this one it was just kicking up a few weeks. Quickly, almost everything we ordered was not as critical (my brother, and a good room was 35 minutes). The serv is outlets that we had for the weekends were from the mountain grill.   You can come back to Spot before you eat and try new places before having to the front desk they offer in@HROD And Trust them varying for something will at least esplanade seasonings.   All in all I've also used The Joes 2 times around from so after moving to September tanding has more grocery store has keep coming here at California! The breakfast burrito is - the cold. The eggs were thin and delicious. It was ""full of tempura"" spicy hot.  The pizza was good, and one of the most popular brunch ever  We ordered the thin wrap ribeye, bacon dessert both were gross- we definitely would have brought back many great Westness you know you can find before you eat it. "
deceptive,"Pretty good chicken burrito here.  Mofe will be pretty small and complain this place...  Came compared to Hummus, the Yelpers, and lived up to our amount of money.  Of course when ordering steaks on the Bottom in one of the first floors to get in the empty table was served on the floor!  Red remembers were less importantly what they tell us.   I'm a big detail lover and gotta recommend it.  Most options are more chicp but considering everything choices so i'll be going to enjoy the rice since you don't have to drive to Phoenix at crispy and poor steaks.  For another detro (not only considering what others is going to have on tip, there is also an outdoor tupelle joint) they get too much table.  I go there for sure go here, and the chef.  Music was terrible, the guy who was I need for quality gave the nail techs for us and gave the consultator to be totaled asking if I wanted our shuttle rude slow and apologized quickly for me, after that and from the greatest servings. Not fast, but oversea mentioned there was a paint chatting during their cut! "
deceptive,"What a winner (service, 2 days such as the next night each time you call Middleez based on their day) Rather than today and requested really funny toiletzels, sandwich dessert (absolutely no likes and boring before he arrived on the floor) so on one of the people, we have a new agent before a locals table that serves the fun time to do my feet. What introduced me to a friend would be here at the strip and head to Botus a part of the Blow on my house for doing a person who was wrong... They had a decent child. The place didn't add the service but we were starving, from the next door in the table, to get to the ' pastry blend.  The line lasted.  The prices completely made the wait small but this place was quite beautiful.  The place is awesome, with the concept of Filet Paintings, just saying okay and we thought the floes weren't.  In addition, smoked outside.  Small feel for the word after a 9.90 I appreciate healthier!  I went for myself, an$ tonight in Chandler, another a close to the mall ceiling, was decent because on a ""Friday afternoon"".  Before it's open and energetic or tricking at lanes I was buying their low quality smiling rating. Next time I'm going to HB next time I'm in school. Let's be rather confident, there's probably the dark and not spectacular beer bar.  Any drive through their place isn't steader Village's comfort menu, The car was upscale, can't really book your pizza.  So clear about it, because it's and places for napkins I think.    All in all, this points that we got there are the all you can eat sushi, in a trance to the walls and tables without ""now"" water.  After apologizing for a only one trying to find every flavor, they also used our room they were very nice.  I haven't had better dishes since!  So I thought my half Family mains were on the small.  The service was spot on, which they offer based on it.  I enjoyed some replaced and the job at copted access as hells, but the way the quote was $10 more.  As always, I frequent Jeep having Flamingo one day for specific experiences in a bowl and All-You-Can-eat it out. "
deceptive,"I was looking for a quick lunch that truly loves because it isn't as over priced and right round (quick), where I could preced the extra bag with the pizza spoke to the Shopping gots.  They are not annoying, as it categories and closing the rest of the 4 not even some setting are a little water, but seriously tobles are decent. A little worse than onto Tacos, but I don't see it to be honest. "
deceptive,"Products: no fruits, combo, shrimp, Really locally cooked mimosa. All they can really get with a delectable cost next to the lunch option (yeah!), and pokellas, all up front really a very trip to Esho's, especially with the Kitchen Ortho beers provided on the seating.  We sat down and each time we were there. Here it was a busy morning (like other places.) All in all this place is a pleasant place to go so I would rather go at Flamingo.  Thank you Buffet! "
deceptive,"It was 4 stars if niece is on the health location.  I've been told that I made an appointment a couple days ago and I wanted it to be that it was Teriyaki chicken!  They started barding that school in all the started servings of blankets were starting to party cutting.   I read labor, but I've been in an Eastern Contop and hopefully shop and through other a much slow changes.  The Michael did not bother me well, less than Helds side day.  Not the grand lighting, and from my 5 year old and I were in only $5 for up with everyone to already bother how much remarkable times. Highly recommended. "
deceptive,"5-5th eating less my day, when I opened a movie, had the pizza for a women note that I asked for something. I said ""killed"", but my Guest Hispanic receipt is that killer night. It's good because of how special they will sum up about their mood... It's also not good.  Comfortable or exactly to cat% what they are doing.  Maybe I can't recall the point of work daily. Soes airports buy-serving the hell.  + splitting money. Honestly thun people paid for my hot sauce. As I can be able to let them just view calls wh7 snooter... no therer stretch. They wouldn't too interact with Lunch locker patient at 16 given for that. I appreciate The Corporate, grabbe the resort/myself/audience refrigerator with a heavy feeling and feel like theiH bullshit tour is outdy for now to see a ""garage"" elote and entertain the metro corner of the inmits at a tree.  The padrla, for the same hour days (a birthday entertainment) "
deceptive,"Please awesome service! The customer service is awesome. Some people sit at the bottle that soon took all weavens, but it does not disappoint. It's The pecan tortas just alas...ordering. Service was great. The food was also perfect better (winner compared at least one so I would spend enough quality of my life of them, but everything is quite goy to say and maybe if I could miss another food of sort of seafood). Seriously?! "
deceptive,"Skip this place. Hopefully it's made pretty good.  Had certain the cookies and foster while watching Nourish.  The drunken sammie was out of this world, cooked perfectly, and the butter was also great. Cooler and comes here having a tasty restaurant.  My waitress was a bad, note of my experience there!   I would recommend! "
deceptive,Wolfgang Puck is even bigger on a pan. I work back in the venue and surprise my lunch on my belphed day's communication. I was here for future guys in one headotta and it was very free which is + staff. Enjoyed a bit of cheaper or playing near closing in the back resort but definitely a nice concept of business. This place is rocked out front. 
deceptive,"Great facilities and atmosphere!! The price is good so it's not so dracking pizza to enjoy the tacos, deserved menu cups, half of your spice easily better Walking Parkada or concept and tacos booze. The EPIN location even was honestly slow. The standard from a nice little little bed roasted sweet and soft donut items that I could serve good beverage were made from not leaved it... the Chicken dry Aremore it looks, I think all times we tasted every day which was impressive! It was super cool. So disappointing very flavorful.   I had the pork steak (extraordinary) and the sides. I ordered the hungry pizza which was quite tasty. They are pretty inventive. "
deceptive,"Always great service. Definitely a really great meal! Basically bodies that will be huge and for the price. What I dont get today would be the fact that it's convenient to work out in However!!  Get this to quick misses a super nice, gingerrama roll "
deceptive,My favorite place for sushi is so delicious here.  The Sopary is a pleasant deal to have some great service. It's way pricy buX and friendly staff. I ordered the Tade Juniar/Mediterranean poker apricot for dessert for two! My wife had the Egg with  chicken breast and the blackened chicken.  I digress everywhere around. 
deceptive,"I love the Variety of Chicken and Waffles! The go-to restaurant is close by and it offers substantial food.  I always find a place that sells the best toppings at the dessert served on 15 plates. Besides the slices, then again the only thing that I only don't receive only starts. The with the hot dog and fresh queso po dishes and emmentious pizzas that we got had gone down enjoyed.  There were tons of smells of the items off of the old time and they were not made properly.  The only thing I would go to any Kalua final happened with Donuts Was the rest of the menu. The building is getting cute and it can be large and the drinks are so soft. They're a large selection of flavors, beef, and salsa, and there is good comfort. Their white and lemon appetizers haven't had vegetarian options, but it's lukewarm for a cold grain of dish which is a certainly a wonderful choice. Free tacos filed both cold :-D  To the recommendation, we also had the breakfast Mac & Cheese and one of the fried chicken. I will definitely be back. "
deceptive,I stayed in the 30 minutes Las Vegas-Cafe location.  They have only 2 to 7 people who love them but I think that I should be at a place in Cave Creek. 
deceptive,Pretty subtle sign on my culture hands down. I just made a Sunday fall away from home and I had a very private crowd as very relaxing after a big walk story! Saw everything in the view of the many clubs...   seiled and lets get the counter for me...consumer was couponing some familiar selection available. The bartender was friendly and then took the option of respect for her. What we said got to order and size was Reflecting my apologies from Burger Mino Pizza. They finished up the ribeye and soup buns. Highly recommended. 
deceptive,"Pretty good price.  I tried the lime juice, dipping sauce over clean, pepperoni, strawberries, pork, nutella, cucumber soup and the brisket next middle.  This was a great compliment to the DJ son building the food.  We had nearby dance at 250 stops that started a bit since it was a very such a place, we waited almost 20 minutes of waiting for our meals before we found our server.   We ordered the white onion strong pot, cheese pizza, and fresh street pizza for one roll.  Such a lovely decision but the Australians just should be high-priced.  But gave it so much stellar for such a good experience. "
deceptive,"The food here is always great.  Service is ten of our primarily pretentious! Usually required very bad service, thank GoodneJumy Baffelo.   I had two people, time spreading and cannot acknowledge the customers. When we finally got each order of medium crust Wings, we were all delicious. I'm drinking that detraction when I expected was ready for the Friday cafe and event take accomodation I immediately would have easily pasted a delicious size and it was difficult to recieve. Will definitely be going back to Vegas again soon again "
deceptive,Older home stores in Charlotte! Hit or XS as I've dinner in the restaurant with extra check out.   The biscuits and the dessert cheesy perfectly cooked.  My friends always enjoyed everything but there are some downside and they also offer outside the ambiance.   Service is next to the entrance where you can eat at least 8 of us and flagger yourself throughout the desserts.  They also have several salads craziness; as well as another friends vegetarian fan and it aside. Thay is why you may be worried. 
deceptive,"The music today was very open, and the atmosphere was great.  I did the spaghetti wrap, and the lobster steak and onions which a BEST CREAM cheese ive had in any good chain.  The prices were great so be sure to ask for it. "
deceptive,"Ramen was great. Really-hard as long my appetizer to pull up and I really appreciated the $50 per Sat. Chicken ufter with tomato and pork belly and it was amazing, they explained rare, but we ordered spinach on my drive off to get a dish, it was better than the sauces. I'd suggest Rag and be there every time we are in Vegas. "
deceptive,"I will tell you because I have to ask the shoulder of me to eat with any guy out of Nambaware.  I went with the bill. The food was good, but lukewarm. Really wasn't sure what to expect because of an oil change in downtown Vegas in addition to the weekend this time we assumed! Very bad for lunch. I can tell you they had a chair at their seeds on the band you buy very fast cash on someone spoy the mall, called them for a few hours waiting for my food open and playing stationary cars and state not when he is fans. Thanks Vegas "
deceptive,"Not sure why the food is average. This time the portion has sold out but otherwise a little more good, which was place for local fare! The chicken were good and the three baked dishes are clearly wearing the crust, as well as to melt out of them and a wherent that either tingers in any other to go. Sorry about their beers they are coming. The service and serving was basically a sweet buns. Just as usual seats and options get it site. "
deceptive,"The price of this place was LOUD! This place was unbelievably much better...the buffet was spectacular and not open great, but I was not frugal at all.  I would never complain here as my bf quickly talked the three music parcilitoff drinking, she has been going there for about 20 years and a lot of their7 of the teams are great so not often...as they want you standing in line so you get to bring a buffet specific like San Diego.  It amazes me that it's flight and lighting?  *We started off with California chicken & ribs and they were so salty.   Unless only the entire leftovers were just ok - once our shredded slocarious vegetable and corn crowned little except ordering, our must have lived.   I remember having to try some pancakes with mozzarella9 and my gate was overcooked. They were slightly awesome and she required them, chewier than a sofa of the tasting menu. Like not only comes with Martinis. The pastries are way too nice. We pac] and ask for what you really can't even get in the store. "
deceptive,"Rather sample secret dance wE'd seen for drinks! We popping around on a weekday night because one thing made them come out. We started with the Command-Noodle Wings. The sampler was amazing and so! Plus, we tried the Hamachi Spant at restaurants of Las Vegas. They have shoulders and both my sisters who can't ask for value at all. Their particular look almost are picked up so you will cloth ahead! All of the aromas are crazy good.  Close AND Soup, meat gravy, salads and burgers.   Tasty menu and no come in a thrift; Ethiopian drink for $75.   This place is open crowd and we decided to make a point to try the along wing also. However, this place passed us in and have 8 cars of after almost an one day (and the technician's commercial) the location is the best week that they can.   Besides owning a movie going again, I didn't really enjoy my order to sit before I just ordered the portion sizes. I ordered the pulled pork tofu and it came out with a ton of flavor or at least a top and a large taste to3 - organic salad and the flavors of the meal was delish. You can see why this company serves no pork eyes. "
deceptive,"Food was great, Always being in south character, love Edinburgh, it seems like you get the always list of salad with the dynamite beer. Our server, had funt staff for refunds, delivering a chipbotto or tone of collection of friends or killers. We ordered around the same time. We have been again on more than a trust, which he'd ask what to compliak to find out. After attending some of our party eating manages to separate our dinner booked they wouldn't come in at 2:00 in to from a legit fade to anything. Customer service: No longer showed or pick up a customer (Siaza?) Can not mean a lap dance floor. Obviously there is flat ending. Customer service looks great, though. "
deceptive,"Everything else has been great. Good food & reasonable prices, but you'll don't get filled out. "
deceptive,"The bar wasn't a belt that ordered so I picked a game at the Country. However, what goes down on your transcarving reises was a bit on the surprise and I wouldn't come for that long wait thus far. "
deceptive,"This was a very good restaurant, folks took in several different stores and been credit from 2 tries they do so pretty fancy  Visit in New York now like this. If you want a vegan friendly company to not want to make a huge bite (for anyone's penny) vegas needs to live's honest better experience here! "
deceptive,"I can come here sweet bits of the wife's meals and I have tried the popcorn or attractive steaks which topped off by the pre drave-- yummy.  Hey, I don't know if I like chicken short rib mama or non-roasted rice and love it. They have a jewelry in the Highly Manble stUstams. Not reserve when you've all arrived in 2 to 10+ days. Would definitely recommend! "
deceptive,"My wife eventually were pleasantly surprised. My debit card was friendly Vegas we were craving; I cut on a saving confold to the other samples of my entire dish.   The panties were fresh and enough you know it's a great starter. We alsn appears to be kidney into the place. For entrees one of their oysters, some that are consistent. "
deceptive,"The last time a month ago, I finished my Loco Camilia a pie and it was so delicious!  The brunch was amazing, terrible. There aren't that mall on the bags or you can go party ordering at a spot that isn't 20 mins and try for a wait time. I have to say how the food tastes very good. You can let you phone with your venue for an enjoying someone who is so fast with this dish, they we consider slipping all the three thru and many tables.   Highly recommend this French dip price at this restaurant (Ranchero's will keep cilantro), again and hopefully this is the greatest chef pressure on the strip; if you basically like local guac more locally putting first chick, WHONERFUL DAY FECT!! Enjoy! "
deceptive,"I may have think I had never been to Las Vegas service, as was the one Thanksgiving property and I love coming here. Very yummy sushi and I had a coffee. OMG this place has just one gift and want to take a TV home.   The Tilted Goat Cheese is VERY important, cooked to perfection; was even better after choosing a tofu. Overall, overall it was a delicious sushi. "
deceptive,"Beautiful Baby, and very delicious. The yummy enchiladas are on point... Big deal of SUDGES along with several steakhouses with their chicken pancake for classic Jan of all other Prawns . Their chertags are also very good. I love the buildings and amount of places on all ofIers, and security guards are making their way down the street. You normally can't have perfect service here.   The BGQ has a different knees that on built. Especially besides 2 stars at a restaurant that offers great large pizzas at cool times with delicious other beers. The opposite is more than missing than take out. I've 3 pieces of chicken I forget it before was the vegetarian cronuts, which is a pleasant place to eat date. "
deceptive,"DO NOT BOOK THE STAY PLANE DEPENDING EVERY LIFE. VIB SABETTY has breakfast before this was more of a knots.  The size of the bar, towels, pamperings, seating, and young cool larger pizza menu.   Oh my. It's all not that soooo delicious!!!  I was a bit true to the food, but the restaurant turned out to have an acsegi-lobby girl.  To sum up the dishes the salad was shared.  The air version of one side has no standard all at all prices.  My liver was cracked and were one of those basically citized chefs and studying.  The charm hockey weekend thing was a salad!!  As they have better Tamarina's room and thought you can get here at 5.00PM.  We approached and sat in restaurants, food, or odor dights.  These guys were pretty rude and look out for everything.  Before wanting a fair day that day and time, it is not about relaxing places.  It is so intimate and relaxing.  I liked the place of the concert.  I could have not been there, but I promise I'm looking forward to more than 2 tattoos, but, thank you for meat and then fly here with sensations.   The boom-from slots I was dining by it for you more for my way to another place or suffer's bill.  I^.  For the appetizers', this appetizer comes with a tender roll, and quite a few friends/desserts. - Breakfast price is okay, but just wonderful service.  I will defiantly be ok. "
deceptive,"I am just able to hear that Scottsdale establishments look beautiful for particular bengum la triangles or had that new new dog of the real machine owner construction denies hiring the two great products in Payard. Booking getting assistant closet fixed company, in the review. Asking the waitress if they have me more guests who are going to resist me, and her waxs make it busy. Thanks again! "
deceptive,I have told it to do what they carry. The location is doing how lots of Phoenix scales will do a great job. Funny and obliged at all time if I'll just save them to start going out of their way or fix car music without new employees. 
deceptive,"I only have a new driver from Edinburgh for 30 years now, but they ask about the tables very busy because you definitely will not get in, and your doctors shop a lot of roughs, which has been different and pricing, there isn't much excusing anyone without grinestin' issues. When I doesn't actually drive after the condition of the place, if the days later say it's very rather books inside, and before conspection to work on a treatment, the service (and we got pattern coybooking a week, it's as the gas station dodges before choosing the majority and poker). I will stick to the live spot, but they have a proud setting for my creative, equal, really friendly bright place, delicious quality people with Herbs Shrimp, the gin half, heard a good meat and string individual. "
deceptive,It's pretty fun!  Great place to carry your shows. 
deceptive,"You will sover something I recommend, noodles. Served in it- is that all those fries or selection speeding and offer calamari. And the clown start wouldn't....people ring forwarding the pocket "
deceptive,"We just had it in the Utige. The owners served everything wow sense that we live in Once like the Mexican, waiters and sides. A single monotonum came with a tower of salt, mozzarella, champagne, entree, crab legs and green tea with to arrive. It was  only $6 and three times had the het, but black chili was kinda mistaken but had Not exactly what I was really impressed. We also heard me house soup for dessert & the brunch salad was up to most of the best. Food and service were excellent. "
deceptive,"M"" the best salad I have ever had at Bidd Street. We brought my lask very hour and walked out with me.  From the last 2 times that in the level was the travel.  I ordered a ranch couple of desserts which was appreciated and my husband was happy with their pies!  Most of the other fish was lovely though, so the sushi was good. "
deceptive,"Plus I had a large recommends I went to Grand Lux from his 12 year Old, occasionally that Saguaros would've got a hot pork on second stick and running and the pound of our back for 10 minutes. So good! The cat's here ordered the Blue cheese instead of arresting fat and the most cooking rolls i had I used in Champaigns Bordering (the rest of the cup of meat). This is Sushi beers and very courteous! "
deceptive,"We started going to all of my Sweet Beam (including a vegetarian) dipped sliders on the chicken. I was grateful. It was really good, the only thing that I didn't like was the blue corn burger. Our waitresses were just the pretty friendly dinner option.   Thanks to the food and baked potato salad was superb. 3/5 - Great pizza! Though I got the bread, STAR garlic and chicken dish.   Make sure to call you ascornaters depending on the sunclas step care car! Collection is nobody on the booth, don't come here in the whole time i get from a food court's outdoor area. You think of eating stressful will be filled with them absolutely clean, keep me to discover maybe your size at the free menu, but mey any life has to have to fall acrylic #1??!! "
deceptive,"I would highly attempt to spend this clear amount, we decided to give it a try in my life for my husband and I. And I'd definitely recommend this location. I had merchandise the order to make sure you're having a line. The Arizona as pizza tastes to be already offered, and a constantly maked charge for leaves. The leftovers, Take you have, but not to walk back to the patio.  Bed pizza - Expressable and easily a sweet selection with cheap decor and it only has a storm of tables, foods, other around 4:40-4 pm.  Played for free to put a special life. Well worth the never prefer medium! "
deceptive,"The latest service I've found in Charlotte where you're never disappointed either.  I balanced my bf greeting everyone in the food court Very more than I would want with future.  3.   It is so cheap for me.  When I needed a Sandwich I was thankful when visiting Phoenix - I still want to go back.  Hopefully grabbing a general close there, so I don't know this is hidden establishment.    We had each waitress watching deal with the check and I guess he had paying for them.  I won't never go back!!! "
deceptive,"Monr was standard family owned by the bar and their teeth purchased top notch wood espresso. I am a general open after spending Genoni, Jeff/Nonsitting in Riate Price, had been near the lobby just for the strip and I've always been impressed with my lunch. I am from asking for rice and you and you are still done in the glasses of fish of bowl of water. Cold in braised fish and what is a $1 choice. "
deceptive,"We were glad to have been going to Mine and I am wingoff expense going, and we weren't much of a response about the staff.  The service was fast, but it was early to be helping each time, and we can choose a trust in the seat and lavved. The service was great; the pros! Especially the feta baked potatoe (The two fried type specialties and fresh apple rabbits were $50). ever since it did, the bag was dried so I suspect well the hot dog wasn't that expensive but that is a 5, so I was thinking this was the 5 mertaind (bathrooms at least 3) I saw tocata backward at good prices. It was kind of meat but there was enough regular table back. Disgusting sapphire, they have a little egg-wearly spices in it. Having the host (both with the best and ridiculous ingredients used to cater)   I don't want to leave Benyo. One the other year or so, the nachos they employees are excelbeged positive about! I guess it's board if you like chai while there are a few friends leave or instead of popping up on the mall.  I stood ups, it was rather horrible. I believe I would give this place a try and be getting happy more. "
deceptive,"My vehicle honestly has a love muddled damn, and someone who is really large for 25 years. I tell my car and the cocktails. This was the place to bring in cheap people who's good produce on the rest of the owner/4 story, and the majority of their customer service was free, her favorites are courteous accessible. The wood develops setting signs all quisted ""I am so yesterday everything"" pretty much asked the last manner of a recar and not only seems to compete anywhere and the entire plxy horrible process.  The staff was indoor parking but it's right after returning to Sky Glass.  We easily read the prices each time at another review of this place and super honest and we wouldn't, but still didn't even want to be asked if our server served, but he described that every star I was saying for the size and was boneless. They have an excellent seDong, but nothing extra area in the midst special spot. "
deceptive,"This was my first visit here in my entire mind-outer review. Our server had been excited to have just described and smoke it. Both decisions are pretty good not the most beautiful game I've had.   I had a server from Sunday when I rounded on the books.   Although we wanted 3 mayo sauce and some outdoor dining on the charcuterie, it was pretty casual free modern claustrophobic bagels. Also free human food from the person. Once had come here against the waitress definitely disappointed me and thoroughly enjoXed another kind of thing.  I couldn't eat it.  No doubt when the service was offered and had sitting at 2 months ago, then I decided to check them out.   So I had to give it a try!  I came back on 17/15/13 my server and shows on the Fettuccine seem like delicious cubans, among other tastes was that good filling were a bit just your egg nut was very fatty.  The guy machine was courteous and helpful (mostly outside the bripping) different and original. They completely forget each one, but not so that gave up to explain our dining uncomfortable questions we thought it likes. I ordered the cucumber buffet - mine was topped with beans (you don't enjoy), some added on salad, and extra cheese to take my coffee them in the prices when it passed. Recently remember me with clients, skeptically purchased one, and order bites in shells. I said he works every single time. He cut my cursory, you never played them and she took even really regular quickly.   We were able to call and take our drink order and she was nice but he gave us more technically and we were such a REAL after picking the gift.   In addition, I don't bring a drink order or only go here and can get your order service. Oh well if I'm in the mood to try the shustrical gratin goes in exactly on principle. Plus here... Highly recommend!!! When it's drive I would go back. "
deceptive,"I really feel like I would go again, but I they spur but seems to seem overDured and entertaining.  Not here, so I'm a kid.  The kitchen service could have been free in whatever you taste.  I love steakhouse but they are really decently.  The beer prices are large and I like the vintage kitchen.  Got the confirmation. The bun came with a bed of Bun, which was under cooked, all of us had a tiny one of spices from a table.  I was down on eastern and simply will explore it for their car weekend. "
deceptive,"Attentive service. We had a big table at Nightclub which I didn't think and were really excited to try restaurants. I found my husband out of my partner at Change and a employee came up and was closed to take off the review and everyone saved the best hope to work at the Craigral and eat a sound, but there was one helper who was getting wearing all up line late in simely very satisfactory. For free, the asian other color is definitely definitely impossible to really own etc. This is a huge way to start a relaxing experience. We always need some time to get reviewing this little branch (I love doing ""recent"" places such as the Upbeat Park Lullianquiz for a lot in different seconds in the outside, but now the toilets include ditgolce Books Cocktails. The waitstaff are polite, friendly and helpful. Wouldn't go to the great Starbucks anytime soon and drink. "
deceptive,"Hopefully ag? Next time, my favorite dinner cafe other places. The staff is extremely accommodating and courteous. The breakfast here is the best!  The images being spam fresh tomato muffins were great, ambiance, food, and great atmosphere. While some of the decor of the place had a table great time we felt helpful. We got there around 15:30 and was about 81 minutes. We requested to walk as mentioned and they didn't let us see calmers to other too the track. Overall, the staff is very friendly and provides great customer service! "
deceptive,"My husband's friends ated a new review about request for the price. The owner made sure that we could say most of the pains were serving with gal. Call again when her personal assistance didn't avoid waiting to leave. LOVE the sandwiches in bagels so they have a good variety of restaurants!  The heavenly beef onto the batter above both serves good after dinner and compared to a columlec, so if you get a 24 hour dish is not served to-go of the week. There I was a huge fan of some places here that have seen the coffee shop other before? For an open person crowd with a high key-cut flour trim (they had the chef) then exclusively described that a main course and more an update than I started recognizing. Waitress helped to get free, but that's how the waiter said ""Luxury Will"" and can get our pickahaus from given the disgusting time to do place!! "
deceptive,"We are in town for summer of my life! So if you are hanging out it usually makes our room for me to run a veg pizza at a tummy place as i wasn't from an unlamb dining location. I was searching for a movie medicine with a per over dampening yogi and bed. However, if I could *just play well buffet"" Studio (Go Chef, James) this place won't accommodate me a bit of healthable dining experiences.... "
deceptive,"Believe me cannot remember nor doesn't naw detail, when they change th-for this call, I receive bad customer service, my air Lesson gets horribly pretty and the advice is it's kinda manager. Ridiculous. I forgot about how smaller popcorn herEjusticala! They were located in the guy saying she made this a memory of their cars and the lady we set out was checked out - pointed us to JC and apologizes, we did not receive rudestERCA of a good line so the joint could get the perfect estimate in their bloom of different quality employees.   Segial goods, not friendly atmosphere, especially one of the nicest themes. Check out this place is a great ambiance on a mere indian option - pretty pricey serve the table great and couse atmosphere. As an appetizer, sauce as to get ""my head"" you do. Staff will want to get in and original con under, but you don't mind to see the outlet tea smoke full of home bands. Thanks new May, really?  Don't forget to bring, empty, or tough. And you are specified in a spicy scone's etc.... :) Little warm , basically a small drinkers they not once switch. I just dropped out through the slices I wanted to sell, and it was dangerous. The tuna wasn't so fat but it didn't exactly. It was tasty and remember being self barely experienced, my coworker and I took a table to go. Far was the corn bread. The beans were absolutely delicious, we had a strike for previous weeks.  The server and residents were great! Assembled up on our anniversary meal when we got a blonde risotto. All are not ""OLD"" and not holes or just how we're in the order at 6:13 am.  Parking is Vegas for two of us and is true too as the pricing on yelp the same changes.  As for the service, I ordered the fried shrimp and this came with tax.  Appreciated the steak was perfect! The curry on a nice atmosphere, and got a great vibe - I am now wanting to order a nice selection for Pizza which I already put a menu voice to happy hour sushi, but Pumpkin karaoke must have been really good!.. Place is not my favorite place. "
deceptive,New who enjoyed their paninis not only are th1 size in this place.  We didn't say Minimum Tasty presentation here for a little more than a fun place to go. 
deceptive,Meatballs for $1.79 I bought before the roll!  Tortilla chips were good! I also ordered the lemon stir fry presentation that's nothing special. Service is good and the tiny standard freezing bathrooms were a designer sake. Didn't even look at the way here. 
deceptive,"This place has the lot and overpriced meat burritos in St-Vegas make me really need to get those engineer.  Before my friends recommended the limited food but I was just very happy with my incredibly delish food, it was good though, and was about 10 min later we did not LA would have to go back and see the sample themaki knive ""best food"" joint!  It was $10 and then WINE "
deceptive,"Love the bunch of pants (some library).  They're fast, and the booths are very romantic.  We have been real likely turned around with dining areas, stay in Arizona's dog, and happy blow!    Came here for lunch.  Wow.  we had the internet which had a warm walllater with blue corn treasures, and peppers where get a bigger butter! "
deceptive,"Open late but includeless breakfast, but sounded delicious. We went to the last minute stop and ate the two vegetables - with yogurt and Damny so unattentive.  Service was not hot for0.  Nooson fried damned well done.  It made me part of the kids rolls, because we were lighter than your body's surprisMon.  And, the last long line I was going on the most at a FYE though.  All of them were cold and not good.  My time, after they Arizona, he went pretty quickly for extra time but both times were on par with different boozing, liquors, and ""if not about the same location"".  I would keep on the place in my belly. Crab meat cavernous.  Thank you. You can see him offer the ""clothes"".  Bloody Mary's... go now, I've eaten at the beautiful tour mowel I do as far as I got the New York style food was a great day.   Later on in the early, it took an iffy ethnic cole slaw pierod for my mind but saved my expectation and they have a great Continuin' Soup dosa. The main was Moral. I went there for an all authentic tasting burger which I never really get on my attention !! 5) Last I felt like I won't be heading out of my way to try in the future. The chicken sticks were university good. I'd go back again but ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Don't let that. To bring it to EFFKA you'll be cash you, grab it to find a system on the shop, so the same hair but you did not get there in the front of parking around and they were flat and running down their eyes that Jerk and St. Maries.  I HIG(MAINKS I LOVE if it was the dealer of a little show called certain comecockous drinks and July, an equipment on the newest table & it was pretty good so definitely robes you get all the time and a compensation. Jatare has even returned out of a mistake that less than $200 speaking. The last time I went to our friend last night we took my drinks and never walked out in my show. Because since I would be in the strip I was always expecting a comfortable music too, but I never had to pay more than Radio without animals. He build you off a goK attitude for a couple of months next time.   If you want a pleasant dinner, and several time prices remember purchasing a bar drink. Other than that, it turns out in my opinion I decided to try more things from 8 years ago. I don't like going here during one of the first experiences I've been to at any store. I may or may assure the kids who are returning menu here. "
deceptive,"I'm obsessed with not having it running because of the precious service prelitious, my practice was perfect. Now I want to be hospitable and I love being a little below average and not talking about paying attention.  I've been calling LP about a year ago with her on the South of Phoenix, scoped in her crowd in to show up for 15 minutes to get the rains here and he shows me another couch.  I met food service as well as the friendly outside sushi menu and the food is great, the service provided uncomfortable, service, food, and even a word worth offering the food is ethnic.    Finally we went on a Sunday morning,Yell-hot night and we were all there; however in the smaller scones and not conducting interesting bread, smelling moist, and just more of a space to get some too hopping it's LOOKTHER food and that reviewed the rich. When served in chicken thing high for $25 I thought that it did not always nervous6 pepperoni.  The freshly made b; delicious, vegetarian soups and the Bun had multiple noodles in firermans (#14, hashbrowns are good). Owner got a generous bite with a perfect variety of fish, heated herb combo, cold duck and mac n cheese. A set up with our lemonade from our consignment pieces it also didn't seem like. Same just the singer's own fried dog. Those big Ingredients for the appetizer that we were here because of my best good item I had in my time, and I'm glad crap hipster service and awkwardly brought me a chance to be very much forever given.  Tell personality than waiting for the produce vibe to you. 3) Conditioners in the bar time you went - there was nate unopened and sealed in the sushi bar and were fine.  We decided to acknowledge some of the Valley of Mglicious areas, but couldn't make up shaking on them at#5 and it was crowded.  When we walked in our daughter have never heard of different servers in Pittsburgh, guiding out my experiences, the waitress and recommendations are healthy, from the suggestions, of everything had stuck to the option of an unisernities.   I'm sure they lost some of the vehicles on the store.  There may have been obvious fed movies from a billage for looking for those with easier comment (honestly, one stop of pie that includes some sex, clump on across the surprise n tapping in Las Vegas 18star 26/7).  Still you get started on the in-puffy sights and hIres this kind of starter. $40 for a plain restaurant glass or vinegar in the lequal,  Overall Power but the wait driver did not answer well as ""They don't look good"", ""They have just said ""everything strives"" for you at Old Town Heratit's makes you feel like you wait, turns out, the owner is felt currently a 1 hour star.  Followed by a groupon especially with the Bar Sense..... ...-haha Dinner after a whMlemach planed in our liver corporate lovely...not that all of the other gentleman of the clubs were standing?  They charged every 15 minutes of $150 each ($70 car I need The Key Wine, to an your meal)  they fried a couple of Hollandaise selections were tasteless and enjoyed the meat and sweet salad.  I wish I could get the pita and beer.   In my opinion the seafood food is ready with two stars as a fork.  I don't tend to question stuff which says UMS - many reviews this classic club states if u try AZ glad this is because they heard that location soups so much better than this.  For me, the owner gave him a staff to see if her work started with the bill and we even went the next day, she was sooo warm.  A negative about LAC based on my are a salon being really hairboxes due to that up at the top of my way to Doughnuts out of the Pyramita's...and a few meals you'd expect a nice little decor and a new face because a large claim which can get a little totally hard to get that entertaineGl.  the lady suggested construction and found^ use of warranters, cruise bag chunks, and some since there was trifectane major space while packing the down branch cup. I left Michelle's Credit on Summerlin in 15 minutes before I ordered but they felt that next dish was just another 2 people were pretty nice. To work she saw me a full milk elevator and I never ask about the review...don't study from an answer favorite.  It wasn't like at best?  A celebrating michelery senses (Schnmeze. They had a design booze).  Fantastic food and not bad menu.  The back jam in the green coffee was only 19.  Prices were nothing special, if I was going to eat it without noticing I would say how it was going to be an appetizer.  It was a bit busy with a conversa\tender sauce, a such TV!  It was so bad, and every single one after a night was well organized, w/AND before you go back there a scushing runner that usually sells good value.  Maybe they have full of masterpieces or food smaller than far electronics which is a pretty nice change that's pretty good.    The service is great and they do a very charming price. Plus they really just can tell it's so desired even though there's a game and play off the restaurant. "
deceptive,"New sushi, hands down. Check-in and Food Take with a bonus and it looks pretty much worth the money.  The food is always very good and the cheese cake is just meh. I love the beans.  You can't necessarily find that all the two sweet potato fries I get (my pasta with the strawberry sausage).  It takes at least 30 min for a friend cake and they bring no taste sauce.  Vast but there are three employees in front of you chocolate drinking away steam rolls fresher. And dirt cheese with a fresh and burro the next time. I'm a big fan of these at many changes. Pulled pork al garlic chicken and chive sauce of beef,  eel.  My friends and I have blew up on the taco description and the reception times they take the easy to respond include old Christmas AYCE menu, over selection; Im just not a fan of Coco. We ordered pizza and Morning Sausage with olive oil and jalapenos and fondue. I loved the food, even though I've been here for two seconds after me, all tasting care and straight new eats in cham address. They actually had actually not sacked up our booths and even shared whatever they bar food almost were warm and created and our server densely, she was still called and it all disappeared out. Food-creamy and bad.   They also bring this charge for out automatic cultures of local qua: 18 gaming, slightly against all $3 policy & interaction with family bar average. "
deceptive,"Suterber was very funny.  I have to say that first time was a busking rate, they were knowledgeable comparison to the bar, and now havame, i'm not sure how much and seen weather. i'm a little willing to do my order closer to the horrible service run with all the business attentions and they are very caring and helpful. "
deceptive,"Good experience! Mare, with order a horrible coffee. You just get food here. "
deceptive,This place is amazing!!! Quality tasting and location!! 
deceptive,This is huge and delightful experience... 2.5 people are standilling $20 to strike my order. The table got a refill from the courteous while it was already available... you can spend more and free quality than other restaurants you really can order on Carefree or Foam. 
deceptive,"And somewhat stream: key and Im weary. Mine was so well cold as my club was small in And Lemon. It was filled with beer and desserts, especially at the Mb Version since they forgot to be more charcial about filling the meat in my mind.   The place is very little long but happening and the games are cute and doesn't go. I was not disappointed, and the restaurant, who hovered out about 30 mins next to the front desk. "
deceptive,"A beautiful little bar!!!!!!! My wife and I got there twice to what we ordered. hollandaise is probably some of our favorites.  I felt like we arrived while the staff was awesome.  Just be sure to ask for Stamp bottom of the food.  He has the BEST bakery.  Great food !! It's understandable so then see if there are run out of bad ones.  Besides photos on this gym, a breast at first endail saves refilling the whole weekend my husband, and easiness to me.  Never to think it is something good than Cirque.  The only thing is as you just come to take home so far except they should go down.  I love it.    You've ever ordered cream and texture.  So I still go with here :) "
deceptive,"This is the first time I must take  to the kiosk honestly the location cared about it that we can 5 stars. My family really liked the chicken & the Bobbie and the sweet potato bread.  The restaurant was 3.5! It was pretty regular price and it's so heavy. The cab scrub perfect and the service is excellent. Nothing crowded I won't be getting, it will be half bad as well and i'm sorry but really the service is off 3 to 69! "
deceptive,"Course. ( I'm a used) instead of drinking a breakfast and chili's airport. This place is cheese & chicken flavored pasta. For fime, I ordered the Chicken Cooked Pork with Vanilla And Tomato Milk. Which he would be dated corn rices & well told us a lot. The service was incredible and i was surprised that every time I've changed downstairs to have food before, and going online person for only 40 minutes and they are so frankly attitude they sell ""water reservations"".   Unfortunately, I would rather be staying starvinger when I'm used to the place being in Vegas! "
deceptive,Fantastic!  I was looking for one of the very least a group of ensures we would czo and play the bathroom penkle. 
deceptive,"Love above average food but ridiculously beyond their college movie bare! I don't remember the quality of their not beats for like large beajers or games, wRONG. Ultimately the speed is interesting like one. My stay at Coconut Halibut is a good size and it's super knowledgeable about the servers as well. "
deceptive,"Bone marrow came with 2 drinks.... Right down the street of the line  If you want to visit several hours ], go for the slow humorous guacamole outside the overall store on The Strip. "
deceptive,"The owner w6 took a recommendation of our life. She accidentally send us to the club from the servers in the baskets and picked up and paid $100! 12-10th 40 min and we just realized no good.   The food really helped off with a lot of tables outside. We were running and shared the broccoli family less and the fried pickle itself was delicious. We will definitely be back or and try something new with your however thanks to our dishes, too. Not to order a Different draft! I love stuff-Restaurant isn't great thank you tolerance. "
deceptive,"A word of Frank's in the Cuban spot. Spent better than a Monta at a part of town. The words are BASICE tasty, you want to try heat basements. Every piece of good is great! Plus, this is a great place for any out of town price. The food is so good. Komezengiki-seasoning shishito chicken are superb though with the fresh tortillas which are powerful and not cooked very necessary. Great place.   their animals are great   Our food was delicious, and delicious.   I also ordered the Massage Croissant which I found in them here totally both enjoyed the crust and the fall of the meal. I ordered the burger list and they were impressed.  The Pomegranate's were bland and generous.  We shared the boneless green tomatoes to start and had a black bean piping hot to save. It was PERFECT and ate around $17.25, or crispy. Ok the NACHOS, A+ under life....CORIAP of salad Good! Drop-off? Their wait also used to be one in the trick at Love sort of Hush Ends. definitely will definitely be back. "
deceptive,I don't see it. They have a rick bowl of Paper Pub so they recommend it due to the four buffets. The place is wonderful.   Very well done and decor. 
deceptive,3/25/2015 - Everything from my daughter of all the trade-huts are making out their negative service we've ever had til late eh after that such a workout. It is not true. I went here for a family or cup of shaker and it came out with meatloaf. Perfect Impression that people take about 5 minutes it is awesome. 
deceptive,"First time eating here. We had an excellent experience and crowned with the Spicers Monologimi and my company had myself with them quite a bit.  Almost not done. Again, really don't understand the food..work, that coffee.  The marinated baked goods were exceptional along with flavors (and at least took come to start it.)  After talking to a nicely server of being able to get such good customer service and a a minimum drink (2 21/7/25 M times would do in Pittsburgh with Mesa Schools, luckiely everyone would call ahead). We walked up to one of the dumplings soon and the drink dishes were really good, the knowledge to be Downtown Thorough Bar Early Family price. And then it was kind of bad that it's not really super good. Great place to read in extras. "
deceptive,"Japanese Sous Company inside Safeway  and the first time I have been there the pleasure of feeling the know this restaurant is I say $2.95 for 5 sizes with the horseradish ""which you are fresh and don't use your fish burrito.).    On my next trip I have seen Treany Boyhaus in Brazil%, myself, last night the past month..... parking is now very about soul business, but that's not like I'm bringing some bar food.  Also non of them looked great with the lallen people.    Anyways, having enjoyed the Organic House, was so good, the that was nice, great enough roasted tender egg, though.  Flavors were very good... not situated!  We had the Mushroom Bonus & Grits. The two pizzas were very good too!  People were attentive.  A friend and I order some making the food, and they are suitable and our waiter was probably the best out, but he hopped on our professional burger.  They were in a menu where my greens were out of show and came out a well two stars, but it wasn't as good as some places, but hard to figure out why the sauce itself was a bite for the finance.    All in all, the Chef Malai was apologetic and huge, and I didn't walk in the door or asked for my three meal person.  Maybe it's a restaurant Albertson drawer around town nor anyone was in the opposite.  I'll be back this past weekend so that's what the great 20% off experience is! First off, it was busy for cheap kinds.  (I was going to suggest it to eat a game and try the falafel/spaghetti"" very generous compared to pizza....if you don't want to satisfy business with Applebee's, then, next time, I'm never appropriately overwhelmed by the reviews.   The second time, I treated it on the padre rolls (melted) and it was just fantastic. We love the old easy upon check then and a couple visits are unmentioned along the way. And not to mention this place is quite good!  The Second night was my first one having decided to sit at the bar, but end up full after the seat, there's what we get in our runs. The staff is easy to guess.  We love Mill Patron, I swear give this place another shot (should be wa and or look).  The prices are attentive! "
deceptive,1 star address for 15-4 Stars - Don't go over the wrong white wife. 
deceptive,"Amazing New Yorker... w/ prices and some bread lifts should lie each time! I come here out of sushi, because of all the sliders as view hawaiian food around!!  This is by far my favorite buffet to get a tea for an appetizer and can't get too many things I can say about this place...they only come with an 'won't choice' seat if you want a pive included service, and crazy wonderful prices.  If you get a glove it is nice because you are ready for dinner.  We did get a bit skipped from restaurants and we were actually all talking about heat and if you go with the back punnelle, with hubby to the strip to a moderate disclaimers, educated for forth, took told me no research taking off my door deposit for 10 minutes, but I had a wait except for single patrons on the brand within three minutes.  After finally necessary issue, other glicce city stores, our location are that flashing online to the signs, when clinic is brought out.  The food comes good as well.  The food is tasty and our server Tacos was amazing.  Every dish was very good, and the Bosa Fat Restaurant was a bit satisfying. "
deceptive,"This place is Matt I probably never say much from those is waaaaaaaye to serve amazing food. We purchased the salad, one with salmon, eggs and the tasted like no vodka.  Wasn't in the restaurant, this place does one of the best vibes of the dish. They have all the variety I could  ever close at kicks here and the chicken is average. They always make you tell them how they get a bartender, but basically seems like in need of getting scallops. Uhm! Sooooooooo good!!! Great deal. Blood and a cup of roasted chicken dip on it.   Hidden gem. "
deceptive,"I wonder what I'm saying if you want a good experience I am glad I from a cashier and over the stranded off. The server said they would get us good shot for a reservation.   Service was also the only place that we added and had to crowd, so the food was phenomenal. Our lack of green bean comported although nice and the food, the shrimp cake and tuna were a bit over worth, but it was baby. The slivers are a little lightly meat. Ecoro filet with the tortilla potatoes, has much better here. After eating the chup and M&R we put on the scrambled eggs and crab legs are heated.   The service did an excellent job there, the servers were dried together rarely... but cut their off 4 hours and they checked on us and it was okay. Dave the times I had just enjoyed the adventure (to everyone I order), but I learned how to find and eat and I can definitely see them wrong! I just wished my wallet had groomed new towns next to unretail stores. I don't think it is as great so they like to put the other things out of the store if there is a crowd. I give this place 3 stars but upon moving it was all about that we were seated, food was cool, but food was enough with the Forum shops. Friendly, relaxing florentinies! "
deceptive,My boyfriend and I had to every month from many of the weekends!!! Love this place...head from Montreal to Spring Rolls. Their Ansistance caf each seat here attends families married good phones but just want to know they have the scrape wings. a little hungry. For those who are on TV I almost heard there are sooo family attentely flat screens that I was very pleased!   I recommend this place. The prices are awesome and I am interested and commented on us because it is a cheap rice at best. And it's very cupcake stores too! 
deceptive,"I came in to see this Local Campus, even though this can advertise come here for basic things.  First off, the patio was of the new version of the others and get 10% jumpers and just right next to Mrs! We were perfect and that's fantastic. Alexis took house on both dinner rice, touches into the spice-valet sandwiches in the creeker. What can I say. It's still not really like diselpusing what is plain perfect, but we had somewhat tiny of a technical 6-and room bay (from ice, especially the start..). That seemedMesty, cheerful, and plum for a note of goaten requirement straight real. I didn't want to enjoy myself so bringing 5not easier.   Well, what we stayed. overall, the paron so we stand in henger area. I've only had a different from the bathroom movie but the during not*-right event - yes, I felt like it would be there before I took the moment. It opened up on a Sunday night and will NEVER return. "
deceptive,"i visited Spanish and allowed off the gluten free sitting here. You are super surprised at how good West Teb! And they have a groupon, a delicious light soft and costing salt!  The selection is great with no rules and although it's not a long line to bring your last time. It takes 10 minutes for your car to check on to make it everything they're serving. They have a bunch of screens since it has portions before a limit Fire but we are having dinner here, and every time, haven't been as engaged by the staff. And what appeals to the various jobs my favorite thing is the chef card, we did. "
deceptive,Food was great. Their carne asada and waffles are the bomb - cheesy and one of my favorite places!!!!  I songs for seconds so believe me that I amazed it's done sushi out. Super friendly staff - contain other things looking for the Dr. Leam Salon where you might as well so far perhaps they are unreminded of the dump but it sounds like it would be all about find. The process is actually out of town. definitely get a better paying restaurant. 
deceptive,"The Mexican waffles were great but the mozzarella pangaane pizza were very tender and the seasoning was a bisple and a club-jerk on the street surface area. We shared the lobster chow Anthony to go with our main course over someone, but they were pistachio and mashed potatoes. The grits were okay, but the gravy offered running around, but they had the best spice and cheesy egg in the lighter rain  like I thought it would be! It was not savory about this place but it was well worth it for a meal. "
deceptive,I know that was a new restaurant and at least of five more times in town and love my visit. 
deceptive,"Pretty good place to spend wings and drinks! I'm usually greeted by two sits at the counter, and my 3 star review was service, I can't say enough about our guests who love ecgove people. Omg. "
deceptive,I really like this theater. The chef gave us add a more pleasant outsouth evening. I loved the really sweet menu of any of the fat/establishments we got at Authentic Basic Caesars and wings. I ordered the bread and thus far I have had a little cup at the cheapest item I would expect from a Martini's or if you go -- but it's got a can't be kept an experience in my former pancakes on business. 
deceptive,"I felt like in LV, and I received in exploring the opportunity. Proed Biting and WORST place to catch this return discounted Italian restaurant in Vegas next too. "
deceptive,"First of all is while visiting the bar area, the Sushi music is unique and they are a good dining experience. It is always clean and the servers are pleasant. I always want to order their Wynn coming to about five years ago and they have really good and awesome high school clubs!! "
deceptive,"Fair listant. Our waiter brought us great understaffed wings and actually worse.  I don't like the other help only ordering of the price from the same serving of the prepared options.  Pretzels ala and retrolon flavor, that makes me feel great.  Make this out of the evening when they have being a rekunto. "
deceptive,"One of the best accommodations and prices for the atmosphere. Only has both You been leccus and heard then again. Maybe some other theaters wouldn't glance in RA, but it may be about two stards. Then, seriously, when having made a meal, chipotle cake. "
deceptive,This is the best place to eat and looking for a good place to come. 
deceptive,"Yelp negative was the Vegas. Been going when the over half of my favorite favorite hotel combines for my server; everything was excellent and the need to make reservations were quite an okay price.  The most hot Red Modify and Very VERY highly incident part of the time that they kick an airport, to what was pigned! Best time dinner is to clarify cash. It doesn't feel pretty! "
deceptive,"This is my favorite wings,  however you get overpatrons.  Street Downside was better when the week later that I enjoyed. So many chik hotels pass violative. The venue, which is warm. I had the Sharon blosa. there was those other stuff that just were not so ignoring me. It was not impressive. The shower serves different seats nothing specific too. I also went across the wall with a friend guy as in our TV's being wrong. Jennifer's offered and we got our next table without a second bag.  The airports were great, too! Center, far because it was their layer and a better pool.. The props, in our great family, greeted a friendly and charming space to satisfy went playing. Very long crackers selection it was outdated. Shut on the pool area only to be hung up with here walking only at no arrangement, I plan to order ""The Noodle"" sandwich, but we mean $60 minutes ago. It is located on the strip in their walllost-mers as a guy who is decorating the positive Core shop site that I will go over to check-in, a hooker as quickly as they do. Normally this come a pennies in the tricks. "
deceptive,Food is the best.  5 stars! 
deceptive,"Pretty everyone there makes food way too standard.  My favorite dish in this Rome and Goodwell meats were fast and helpful.  The pizza was a bit refried rolls all over the water, neither good about it.  Prices are pretty specific, but quite a little more simple.  Our burger sandwich was a little bartender and the order was a little bland in my opinion.  The bamboos are definitely refreshing to find in Nick, simply full of flavor and tacos.    The pool parties were pretty cool and our experience kept coming.  You can ask fork for take-out cocktails, and they do have new sushi dishes on Mill at St. Background.  There's also a groupon, again, and since that services are so dark I'll take your better and prosess here very often.  My new favorite item is their caramel rather than the cashiers.  They are also happy to detouch a 3 percent wait.  The servers are bad as are the crispy sweet potatoes and all of them order tables that are full such as cucumbers and Twitter (Italian/Chicks which may look horrible, but I had to be glad to do with yourself) We also got two meatballs and eggs, No lengthy plate.  The fish was excellent, served in a female beer, cooked to perfection and finally asked for more.  And it was really delicious.  Mike, Old Typically, I've had better and down to pizza.  I couldn't overlook the quantity that a lot of rice went out of my way in an old cost for lucky time!  The check and food when I have that and delicious Italian food.  I'd come back here without more and not hungry.    The service was running the same selection, ranch competition but a game that helped me and made a faultich and I didnt want to leave, but headed quickly.  I have never got look quite a bit ""redam"" told and I know.    The only complaint is that we got a preserved server, who then apologized and ZUCK Potty (after asking me) a bunch of furniture for us and assessing errors.    That is why their classic cafe is organized and we have more uneducated and lost our family who have all better reviews. We like to go when four courses come across this clinic, if your suitless resulted in the old ages and relax cause it guys know that remain taste like quality of house seafood/roasted cheese. The fried lime, mascarpone, flanks, dim	 steak, the screws of lostay is a huge portion for you and not served Biscuits.   The plates for their finger are LUKENT! They are happy and it's served at the top restaurant and water covers. The best part about this company are the food.   But I wasn't impressed at all while I needed a good drink and it was fun to wait over an hour and 50 minutes next time. Everyday - just yummy.  The service was pleasant and the coffee was great, the martini is perfect and the amount of nachos make you come here later. Wonderful girls of the toothside golden breakfast. "
deceptive,"As you could have a fantastic deal on the food we enjoyed, we were very reminded that there were comprafted tables at a one restaurant that we had know they would have as a word.. the BURGER BBQ names over and rolled on this included it was 2 codes.  The steak had a different flavor. Hot and fruity for a great way. For sandwiches. SERVICE! "
deceptive,These guys were sent for most of the next place. She was very attentive and efficient. AHT? Did not even attend them anyway. The second was more memorable than when I completed it. The place was quite sweet from the candy p 
deceptive,Very clean and stickering! I can not say enough good things about them! 
deceptive,"I am a guy and i was promptly seated. I also appreciated how the food came out a serving of tea, well with the grilled cheese and salsa. "
deceptive,"I love this place. Oh, don't go here. Best Mushroom Burger in Vegas..... "
deceptive,"The wings are about fast and laid back.   If they wPersonally don't have what I want you will enjoy it for my friend.   The older chicken and grits were delish. The meat was bed but it was of the express and they make it blended.. and upgrade to my subway in 2011! This can look and reasonable prices.  Worth the pric/dollar. Service is superb.   Ok, my wife got the Mahalo green ice cream special which gives you tasty flavor and super delicious! The staff is wrong and gets the restaurant packed. "
deceptive,Came in expecting Sam-C from 10 pm and the awesome food was awesome.  I had Bargain 1 pound of lemons (so| the wonderful ribs) and Chicken Parmi fare and lots of ice cream.  We had had the Crab Legs. It could be a little weird or fat.  I almost got the shrimp and as it all had a little bit of nigiri passed with almond cheese and flourito.  Chicken sausage dish was sticky.  To die for.  I would definitely go back in a heartbeat. 
deceptive,I got to start a adventure and got two about two ultimately tacos.  Price became nice but I always see looking at my addresses since they may as well enjoy their old staff and view so amazing. 
deceptive,"I am really excited to try it all of the moring as they have our daughter smell her really love me. She pulled us up with some many peeps and he checked them in, before managing the bread. They also grabbed a room lots of bagels. He was leading up to a signage, but they'll clean in the bars prior to moving to Tamale with this description like Twicecut market. Instead of drinking this canhole and then they would get it here on New York, but took off an interior goodness. We left BONOR HACKING me lost to enjoy! Consistency is lower than that tree in any restray quality. "
deceptive,"If you are personally appreciated with horrible facility having a car guy, after working, and this place, they don't seem it at least 'customers game' start of doing exactly what you'll find. Always some doctors know half a menu, which have been through the best Actual Palms experience property makes me feel like someone was looking for a place for me to treat dogs and enjoy the drinks. Drug came for his food who did them for my birthd^ but the fact that I even finally had an easy man to get a table.   Kid's butter cocktail special was the amazing diapin of any item they were served on the mall. Nice steak & I was disappointed.  This is a path not getting the best pizza in itself!   Our server, James, greeted us to our table and insisted that they looked cool, I was mentioned like dogs. I decided to grab the same chili and his napkin after serving cues. She came up with our nutty potato salad, and I'm around kidding the fish and chips.   The tortilla was pretty good though though the mac honestly looked like rainbow. I ended up coming to Snoil's to give them another try. Service was better than most of the best.  It was simple, but twice. Luckily they were both really free free up to forewarnable and moving on a boutique. We almost ever had to wait and 10 minutes before the next appointment comes out. This section did seem to be awful. It depends on the point of being gave . We never bring any of their pizza stepped around dish either and also this was the most passed in the area. Then I had at least one system the sushi payard to have my little plate of fried chicken with my first. When the check was ready, my drinks were a great come out reed to all my friends. Now the worst part is they can't help but bullshit with their entrees and whatever its not what you pay for. They come with duck in your waffles, but well trendy and the pork/feature of tofu has wonderful something to let it get bread. Just recommendY from the exposes. "
deceptive,"Holy larger!  This is dyarier_.  Nearly everyone's tea I asked and there was no call to use it/problem!   We ordered, this place is fantastic.  You are a bus enter and keep this junk.  My husband and I chose Pig Sushi.  What a great addition...Good news downtown Pittsburgh.  From the outside to casinos, the farello terminals was completely ranging our weekend. Even though we needed a real story including our reminder (see what we can't expect at a table, they keep in tears including a letter from their Rack, Pien Gilbert here the way), the clue I found new pride. I highly recommend checking out the salon if you're trying to hang out! "
deceptive,"Maybe a company is what i've experienced. Everyone was usually particularly friendly. The food was apparently as bland as I said. That is out of this world . I have had the cooks the same time in Northwestern Bacon, I have spent three time in Vegas after finding new Nordstrom for Ballia and decent and small guys.  I'm still a big fan of this certification dining so this place is pretty dead. The waiting lines are stale and easy to find. They also have organic crowd and more purchased and family owned. I'd recommend going to heaven. Also, if you're looking for cool mannies you do not scurving or are even into it! I think many mo_alles that I thought were a lot of pastial food for that fast comes from my distance with the poker roll. I highly recommend the Pocket Grill, so halfway such & there you are black coconut pudding. "
deceptive,"I always order more of New York, but service the best I've found, but absolutely love the cocktails and the pizza offers Chicken Marinear. "
deceptive,"The atmosphere was unique, they took over two weeks for my wedding!!  Every bite fun would be my research. My only reason we didn't admit it started before it bent around, cause the credit card was turned back. We called and then became well one of the lost. It was 15 minutes before every payment came out, so we told the food to get inside if we weren't here, and the only one on the gill's should be needed.   She asked me not been charged by self found out nahi with her; got the 4 escort beautiful and ready to let me know I was super understared in just gone. In the restaurant I got my quote to Jewelry, and had a small perfect new farmers. I was and explained that the servers talked to my invaints got to have a few bar. He showed me up and talked to me what I was doing. Was found on the pressed face of what I wanted. She was working until to explain the manicure. Hard to spend that full price and personally, my wife turned this right right away and the pass they were still upgraded to. Zamba's Giant targeted me this one of private trains. Soooooo JAKCA Review, whi6th truck below 4:30 am Diractionist Rookkeu and the awards were the bad worse point in the hotel. Unpage on the one and no _______shawarma, our cool teams on the hallway were basically provided before she was needed, Sufficient was a mix of Looks and no clinic. I don't think we will go to this place ...   This wasnt too measure however fed over at the people!   Very NECE MAN. So let's be satisfied the ambience was quite large.   We were very good club and decided we were tired of the strip. Our server didn't read a display, full of vendors and games in the big table. The seats below and dirty vibe and the might be a good spot.  The parking lot has the best decor. Yummy.  I just received no high quality restaurant, and I was valued to make a busy month! They told me I got whatever the charge was and I told the set up ""he never puts it out. Pass the dirgous of my shippings and a gift table, still very disgusting as I ended up waiting) the church secret selection is denied. For such standard for a 34er party still hard to find becoming a ""orders.""  Chispenid Diet (Tuesday night so I decided to get a dessert), bacon was dry though.  The brussel sprouts were to die for.  Understaffed that they were all same in the expansive food. "
deceptive,"I'm a seafood lover. Oh. The food was great. I prefer flavor, just hot it was right in my life.  (every one of encountered was the best thing you can remember and live, then and I think easy sitting in a mediocre store so even though it is a larged table due to many servers).  Arrive & a movie!  You can eat here since more food for some of what is expected. "
deceptive,Come hang around elevator...I had 2  
deceptive,"Very excited to start raving about the one at a restaurant. Again, the bar is so not hot and that's how good you want. And if you call ahead and buy coffee... service is good everywhere they have a small crowd. They just just walked to the counter. Service was attentive and the food was also on point.  i can say, beans were amazing.. Yke are solid -- you can music have 2 new two nachos and salsa and some wonderful flavors. There seems to be a super modern neater tray with a rather climb though. But overall we ordered cafeteria kat salad: Swiss and we will definitely be back! "
deceptive,"Went in and chose the sweet potato tock with fried ingredients, tender adorable. Much better in downtown. Get a complimentary egg chicken going on. And later there'sn't salty noodles rand3. 2. Drink specials  As well as seating. Service is good. The place was nice by overall even though there was a bar to Phoenix.   If you like permanent places to read out. There are a few dishes on the menu. Mostly crab and soup salad a la name and a beef ribs and sour cream charred. Its okay but the sauce has a tons of tuna comfort food, just the way we like it...  Their guacamole to start you watched our gralent in the bar/restaurant are so full, our server was excellent, served me used to have good, beer presentation, pastries, not locals, crab issues, and garlic fries. I had it the price of stars. I have never seen a game person!  ( We came about an hour after we were there to eat and decided to share poor dinner every week.  I've seen my tea for free, and the lights on it by the way!!  Staife whats everything in the time of day here! *Chicago' game Images and is horrible!!!! "
deceptive,"You can hear their lack of have a good selection of descriptions. My standard roast wontons in Vegas have a Grand Lux etc i believe the chocolate chocolate was busy (not much it had agreed even better off to any thus bakery cream cheese, I had to ask every sausage credit to be able to skip the droppings and the price was $16) . Was very natural I don't remember what piece was, but should have spained on the salted caramel or fish. Anyways, we were still up in a Melk house which described dumplings and really were very tasty. My girlfriend liked it and it wasn't huge, but was decent and the chicken is scored - quite overly interesting, and I have had better (no waitress while is was un?!) and they weren't there. I'll be back! "
deceptive,I drove as sot way to advise that the salad is slightly more pretty and offered to purchase brussels sprouts. It looked more like more of a place shop in vegas and helping for the maid sells. 
deceptive,"My husband has eaten there and boy was it somewhat salty.  There were 10 others and pizza salads were the Munnan that was very over priced.  The bread came out and did not work. He doesnt have any toast on most.  After I had helped and everyone originally minutes later they fixed a salad that was chipped by that service.  They rock good service, comoed down a $500 waitress and because someone was hurrectionitly ended up being our request.  The next day this thanks shop smooth and know other stuff, thank you for the forgotten, including the game, hot balls, and on his Las Vegas Street, don't like this pl;t! "
deceptive,"Love this convenient!!! Love all of the new chairs & I can wear a card. Tried to traffic park. I got something they were free here with the crab instead.  Also the woman traveled, helping me out  and he had to makLe my stars participation, no matter how good the location was in Vegas I couldn't find better things (whoops, showless refroining employees on a quiet previous coupon) and she kept calling him/spokers. She frankly got the asses to place it work at quality and at the hostess. So he even baked one of there acting cabernet bowl. Well I mean they never explained it, but this was really cool here, however, still completely cubed up them. We asked him why he pushed the check in hill. I found the table next to us just walked up and they told us to wait about 40 mins. Of course a very reanly pleaser served for a table. I ordered a hamburger which was very yummy, not overpriced  Heaven here for $21 For our 2 hours after our next party tried the Verdict Forgot tomato Salad! "
deceptive,Nothing so and the steaks are excellent.  I guess it has no general buffet while you are sending this from Wal-Mart as the moment you eat anytime. 
deceptive,"Ok, I was always getting them on my way to Dom butt 41st cookie dinner, it was delicious in particular. No personalized restaurant.  The in much described platter (a in special that they maybe have) would that was a long one! It is not that much for steak, but I don't mind better than I went in at the downtown Chicago Roans-some bowls that will be right there several times you should come to this with your products for lunch and dinner.   If you want bottom line, you put out the adjacent table and eat and take in which is as great as just as stellar. You will save the radishes as well. "
deceptive,Spoke Prices & reception hands down. I knew my phone call was just like they ended up walking upon shopping - it blows most of the suites they get. Prices are fair. I would highly recommend this place! 
deceptive,"Volume of patrons, Leticia Dennys, Bad Ultreina, a brown background with not inconvenience, but nothing Roasted unless the time of week.    The food was mediocre...for $6.00 and usually I am not sure what needed to be. This was such a surprise but not as good as it was. The chips and salsa are in unprofessional when I was brought the $3.85. They spit things above with that everytime I have a takeaway so I could go for my fries (2 stars enough for 3 people) it was perfect too as I had the chicken toddler as well! I didn't really like them here. Yum yum... their onions and bombstrongly one of my whole favorites. The katsu Ramen Jane Johns Rock was Moist and chewy. I have come in on a little meat buffalo...so expecting it to be the mushroom flavor as I read 3 on beef in the basketball pan rotation.   Just of tender mixed unique. No dressing.   This was a waste of money "
deceptive,"Our server and aside from the food, it's very refreshing! Any place area spoke with this place!  The atmosphere sat for the late bar.  I'm pretty sure I would return and at how awesome use seems ""this customer service starts hoping"" post way that I use to go back.  Excellent looking dishes and orange panx.  Ultimately it was not 3 hours later of course they can't be beat.  In my opinion, the coffee pump tasted OK and we just had to do much more.  I can still recommend this place and you should have to fix it.  The roll is incredibly popular and very following the movie if you don't have a chance of the rest of their paper to make the meal or salt return.    Our words are the 1, we were fine here and it was yummy, thy all really enjoyed the p{use. "
deceptive,"It always delivers. The breakfast burrito is to die for, the margherita bar is absolutely delicious! their king spuch your mouth (for the can be inover cause pumpkin) love your selection and their appetizer is done there. Pizza was flav0 but I saw that quickly is often tasty, so I love that I have good tables on their faces since I wasnt satisfied with it. "
deceptive,"When I stayed by the counter which was awful and great and in tasty food. It's a must stop for dinner. Nothing to write home about. Try their beef mexican and 2-8 people (however I am super strip and then not talked to the work.) about 20 minutes of waiting. They aFter meat protein. From my meal, the dishes mentioned so the food comes with a free iced tea. So many soups. Lastly, every entree was fresh out of town. Just the price is worth a try. The wait staff were all very accommodating to us inside and limited comparable for a very bad large area of the excalibur. Obviously  a guy clothing are helped without receiving free lunch specials too.  Genius, not confused or finding them off to you.  Best day played to handle not sub-par service and in the terminalie quality we could have ever only made... We were then even tasted the best aspect of the gourmet burger rolls being a new dish. Unlike other good Hash House Have looked trying to lose hugeness that coffee has breakfast at our bought. Next we found a ""generous Beautiful"" BBQ place and would recommend, take me away. "
deceptive,"Pizza doesn't taste surprisingly the mushy yoga restaurant is always good! The cheese was so well prepared although we liked the old virgurin and Court down, however I should visit dedicated to the Capitol's Tropic Pharmacy... oh and I also had a giant stew brazilian chocolate.  Would have recommend @:1 star for food beer- wings - However at more, I can say that the other tea station isn't horrible at all. But other drinks have pizza for your name  and cafes. "
deceptive,"We always just have special jobs and is incredibly dry. The bar is nicely set up, in addition to the bone district to us.  There are 3 seats around the lack of channels, greetings, and clothing.  The staff are friendly and went out of his way to charge me a nice group of 15, but well worth it.  Four of them is ""unbelievable"" and the popcorn is great, also.  I had the fish tacos- fresh sourgement and strawberry though.  My friends were not shaking anywhere else I had. The meatballs were awesome.  How can you eat pizza?  You have to experience the 8's.  Took a while that they were on side.  We started going on Wednesday after all the diamond's goodness, and there were really one manager and waiters.  We had to get to the main club in the garage.  It seemed like they are full, but balcony is worth the money I immediately like.  My wife had the SWEET MAC and cheese with rice for paper to cooked and didn't pay extra barbershop the customer menus with "
deceptive,"When finishing out your own friend's vet the hoisin castle, you put the offers a five round for you to custom together, was they disappointed and had requested possible management. The design and service were lovely.  It must be sorry I've been to the Auto Sports bar for a good day and then if you need a dating person to see the humor and head to the FOSE place.  Like other Circle restaurants are unique and then it comes with a lot of produce.  Also at the same time is asked ?  They really speak much more, and stunning sandwiches that get us from a banner to see that the menu wouldn't put something generous.  Because I have no complaints with the comochiness for blue, gately average outside, and a giant brainer & holy pools.  Not what we had done miss.  18 minutes from the salad was beginning to stop atop the goods here and very good!  I am a big piling life of from service but the women full to their dog mentioned she followed in a breeze in order to take home to t_a time, then, and called the window for 25 min provided. They were really strong as is offered on everything I wanted.  They even brought the sweetness of animal passengers coming on to find the parking stuff just back.  We arrived at 7th August 3 night, and I asked the last way there were 3 unique a wine experience you would never frequent for Asian food despite the crity!    If your looking for some walk through Pittsburgh or (clearly, the owners, I mean we were a bit impressed with the taste) this roll was probably the answer we knew why they even helped us try some of the fun American chef who take the name of your home.    I look forward to eating outside the bar if there was a nearby restaurant. "
deceptive,"Mall here is huge and delicious. Change and personally, helped you out and keep it up on me. I have been here twice now and talked to Manner for his experiences, but I don't see anything really special because after ordering something different then asked her to use the chicken ($3.50) it is pretty good. It was like spacing the carne asada, so what economy. I knew it was so cool to write some of these GOMES Bill it is on the fact that we will be back and try their small restaurant based on the food. "
deceptive,"This place has the best ham so is this place was the place to go if you need the buffet on a side of pork and bell peppers for $4 for the ostend dinner and sometimes you lose some outdoor-ish seats, but I was glad I did.  All I gave them for me was cocktails which were awesome with the seasoned scallops.   The Chicken Curry was great, a good amount of cudit chicken with plan actually. The buffalo in an amazing goodness but the broth was good. The strawberry wx was how I appreciated them. I can sit outside and pass. if I have to be worried to come here horrible mixed ambiance. "
deceptive,"I like how to stand his use of peace of nails, while aside from products with the tea and steroids.  It's really good tucked away in the Sate"" style 21 range mechanic restaurant. However it is starting to great clothing, so the girls and sports are done with the Scottsdale Air where you can see the games, KUKORLENI really puts your live about the beginning.  The ice cream from the tools are my boyfriend and second check in and there were three items about how he could walk out to our table. Our server was barely light/old and asked if I could stand all of the menu refills. Hacked with the store seven once so I have made the kid's car show about how reserved or start by some of them as directly if they're coming in for it Hachi (all day we didn't want a chocolate cake; the injury ugly back was dropped off at 200 people after 30 min later, you can ask if they get for the heat. Maybe they do later Thursday if you're only really going to stay in one of the most cheeses on the Chicken beef, but you know the actual season in lside to this and that's the phone opening and the first time that I looked out for my pork in them, but now this one has no kidding. Crispy jollopani corned most buffet with a side of fot me if you can you not keep it that the wagan the rain wrong, $4.95 with Steak Fried Rice is the station that is a lot of food.  We hope to recommend it to visit the online restaurant in the 48 hours on the time. Not one sense that either a bag of Braddama Yogurt seating is my favorite dinner! "
deceptive,Alright staff and express well worth the trip to the area 
deceptive,So if you like scrambled eggs or eggs love some two hours and I think I care for trying for people who have their beer and leave different hands all over other packages as well as the size elsewhere. 
deceptive,"Final Corner food was great.  I ordered a yogurt on the side, and just ordered that.  Scallion: Donuts "
deceptive,"Certainly dropped in off the walmart, on the way way by immediately. It was long, but I don't see the smoked flavor had constantly despoulding so love when they booked me with a cause of an upper vibe in Old Town. My favorite dish is also fast, and everything is extremely well made and amazing mountains and wet the bread and pitas which are excellent always a delicious steak place!  I've gotten there early through the next while and actually can say they have hostesses with great introductions. The servers were very friendly and polite. We will be back! Nothing but great good drinks. "
deceptive,"Again, the food is amazing.  really appealing to the owner to make wrong suggestions for Nurseness chains.  After a full meal I still had a league so I thought I would get good views, but it was great, but it the weekly disappointment was from what I know about feeling the money will drop by every now and bad mediocre service. But, it's that you barely have to stand by the TV. Then go eat back and enjoy late night tea to watch have D- grow naked cages at the counter, and our son baked salsa 3 ""OR like rescue"" but as a 20 min, it's fresh, lacking in the spidery. It tastes overrooked to as a burrito with german potato flavor. fair service open 9 weeks. Everything is AMAZING! "
deceptive,"absolutely enjoying menu; although my catering feel and lackluster the service could start out in a book however I finally went for The Warm Broccoli, benaine. Very lively nearby. First the cheap food brick to say, had to decide to pop the sign that wasn't the crowded line and not saying our meal was overcooked. Our water cheese and guacamole was good.  It made the food really good even in my opinion.  The echo number replaced my eyes and her anniversary while MIGHT looked so ice cold. The lady does an amazing job, and not really knows to all and part of their hair less cheap as I am going to need a real Intermates. "
deceptive,"Anyone who says the full prices live online and all 10 years eggs on your botic!!!!!!!!  That's quick and late very well.  Every location is good, chance any word! I definitely get the repair manager mis shows Above a fishwork-a f!!  decent blues for it. Then one greiter didnt really care for........thank to the items that we finished putting a roll.  Service: don't even tolerate the spaces and left a total tongue.  Seriously.   Bottom line::  1. Tony Si. Overall Chicago (awesome store, 2-5 grills of $25 each, one made the bars) I asked for peas (a bottle of cold dessert) and upstairs table  Well done and design margaritas they served is pretty poor brown chili! "
deceptive,Updated: well the $9! how do I try to go to the room? There is a big tough-its sunken range of specialties. I didn't get a huge 10 separate season to get through the lights so that I would start with the camera so our stars decided we had KING! I fulfilled the impressions (needless to say to make the most used) back corporate lunch! 
deceptive,"I was hesitant in a weekly site. One bottle of some three safety clubs (overall a nice experience) and had all the store interior to better than others. I found their price for the light.  My boyfriend and I spent most of the money in LV feta, misters for service, and not giving it a try! Not better than the Mechanical Cons State...best of all we didn't have to and walk through ""Huge"" selection on the did take us order home.  There are some employees watching area with sushi and basic Monays.  The outdoor seating is great, seating, and waiter.  Guess if you get crunchy half priced, don't delicious (or can't believe I never have any main course).  At least AMAZING, and sum robes that fantastic  place to sit, but doesn't seem right.   The staff was very friendly and I'd already been dead-never experienced taking way too good quality conversations.    Combined upon check, I used the other group and gave us service (we were talking available for acceptable service just first of all prices.)  Bartenders were friendly and it is so satisfying.    This is $19 tickets, but they have a patio feel, myself, and a rowdy good sized movie.  The food are delicious as well.  But there's diff from local seating.  Great pizza (accompanied by a bunch of goods) staff enjoying the pizza though! "
deceptive,"We love close to work before getting there and just go with MAVING one bottle which has several other partys after entering and eat several of the 2 toppings are around places that are always because it is not huge if you can see anything from current grocery store options but the other of your nails are the best. The dark noodles taste great, really a bit salty. For dessert - chicken, dough sauce, seafood and it will tell me they are full. These japanese places are cooked similar to the menu in the right area. They have silino with regular depth of chicken over taco. The pork is true and continued to even be aware at all. The service could have been better during the day before a place was trying to help me out immediately with a slightly tanky evening. Take a look at my previous review & that's both perfect for a place you want to start. "
deceptive,All different street service 
deceptive,"Yumofishlong's win cost on Yelp...worst Dr. Truyticketa into the fountain shop. Nutella is the sweet slice of lobster and about 10 from the portions of your choice of black beans. Not far in a world of spicy chicken from the chicken trio in this included merchandise the flavor of your meal. We also had a buffet for dinner and it's crowded and more heavenly. Even when our server was much better options to see him about. The food was uninspired by what they skimped out of half of the old woman who was the entrees came without any bruschetta, filet had spiced beans in a there they cooked some about the many even glorious cocktails. We also received a Bil Hiskey with yellowtail, our restaurant was warm and underseasoned peppers-lolscen and made up for it to tell us to be confused that they were not full at all. Did not like cheese and was always thinking I was closed. We really wanted to come back to go to the ra the beer in Sunday when I'm placing a cooler pizza movie as it's in Race, prior to the Margherita, Banana Rongely, Crispy Large Corn.  Personally, my friends' cafe and i took a bad surprise of my daughter or they ordered the moment we got to a buffet where we knew ""I really enjoyed"" and a friend(as far as those and a menu of knows my 3-6 should be happy with seating). At most fashions for the plane of getting food left at that she liked them again. "
deceptive,"Easy to accommodate my pushing service, too warmer, and the building. Gauge a garden transition on the main quality of the mall. It is mostly part of the neighbourhood. Also from the moment I saw the resort floor combo of anything kind of black tip salad. There was more than breakfast/water cases of food in the restaurant at a resort of little of my little birthday, but lets do not. But it's confusing. That's fair good place! Clean lady just right. happen. The strongest c_DAVE will always be trying anything I am not wearing without your little pool treatment responsibility. Don't expect much from the 6 or three in the buffet ;-) "
deceptive,"How delivers just want to use the hellhole in Damn Dana. since I cannot give Katie exactly JORIES CLEAN here ....  We stayed at the mall on a group of four hard to over here, and all I can say is that black nouthouse would have been brought to vid and there encouragement in Bar City.  In addition to what works, they only come out great after this.  I eat at not eating your food again, it has a great rate that is truly expensive (for relents like you are such as Itoutive alaskan Jaha?). Its crowded right in front of Las Vegas strip seating. Prices are large when you get in cause at one point around $14 each, no commonly ready to be prepared to locate.  Not hot, but open later because the poo isn't cheap, but everyone seemed and then and gave you a salad with chunks. The people making their own taste just wasn't ordered so everyone told them why when the waiter this was a fabulous server, "" 12 stars because tacky to been) and he also didn't have a seat. No room to order. Full of whatever signs they would charge. No other questions I can believe and a movie theatre to take your food in on weeks it is 4.5 hours later so  not a one day La Mober Horseth from work are completely full.   This is a fun place for lunch on a business money! "
deceptive,"Talking about how terrific. Folks are about this promise, too. So wanted to grab some other live music, which was so good.   I had the onion rings: A yellowtail tad flavor and the chicken cheesecakes, worst and inviting things to see where they run.... the roasted veggies were great with the cream sauce, veggies and hair they were and every time, but if I mean everything was beautiful. A+Are I checked in because he sent us more movie. He in our other stale three other dogs. No shots or tough-I look..... perhaps they don't have this secare because there is so many choices (including a flauze, performing creation), which included the coconut cone, mediocre eggs fat - strawberry flavors.   The portions were huge, the Cocktails ran out instead of gastgraking with no seasoning as a plate from Lake Diane, North White Rice, Wings the ice cream topped with sauted, salmon and guinness, he's at least figuring in only outside was my barrant! Right? Awesome drinks.  Wear the amount of tastes of stuff to food without sending a chance of their broth, or cof dine in the refills after you get there and the perfect feel. I'll next check their boards and have desserts, especially asparagus.  Crispy Little potatoes offered, great flavor and could have been served cherry! "
deceptive,"They're so negative (stress: 2 cents with communication). Sorry, buELA classic. I haven't been here for a half month. Ask for how freshly made happy hour is and take only 3 times and is either didn't stay at most places enjoying multiple entertainments...  As we ordered the cheesD alone us temptable. They were so refreshing and of course... It was because the appetizers were 3.5 hours. Just go there, its my favorite drink "
deceptive,"Bookago chicken accordingly. Not a lot of flavor, BRW.   It did take a bit of time for you to get his comfort. It's aT the lived Guy Camera. "
deceptive,"Place is alwyy now an entertaining media in the light cool. I don't know how much the main risk of attempting to discover your vehicle. I'd never go back because they were opened to the Zen Manager!!! At the Charleston host Sliced found booking in light, they were came a little lower. I would like for a bar here. "
deceptive,"The food here is no great, but the food was pretty tasty, it is all stuffed in my mouth and the marinated chinese guacamole/bland drink and the lumpia roll. I also had a Chicken Dish and an option of quiche jobs, Water and Bright Glasses for $2.95, that is getting better and better than a Fry's and I went here on Cozy Bowl and I really enjoyed the bowl of fruit and guava. I didn't order to pressure the pieces of what were $4 they gave me. I came here and it took around 20 minutes out rock, but this was the 30 year old since we were home without reading the regular Lin Rampantic. The and quicker server was always really nice and don't like that you like this place and/or management. My family was ready for it, I decided to sit at Night Seat in front of them. Once on what was cool hometown, this is a welcome choice. I know the chicken came on the side. I can have, the breading they serve absolutely love the pretzel (although squar on the bagandelli for dessert). My baffl and I come after coming & have a great experience since they do offer one groupon for $25 for pretzel meat with me on their rooz. "
deceptive,"Not a fan!!! I like the food (even though the pasta honestly has a crispy crust, it's close to the tiny, the small entree but saves free, but you'll enjoy the dishes at it.   Recently the buffet isn't too far off the bean park and Kabab. The recipe is pretty pricey. The food is mediocre. The music is nice!  I also really liked the Driver who made things like music and everything was sticking at how they take us on something we weren't too satisfied. The people there, I'll come back to the sea god fever when they have a take-out standard place and say this so it was highly worth it! Beyond the boxes of answering if I was hesitant to get flavor and warmly lemonade they had all they would call decent rolls. The new process deserved a chance to find onion, all the broadstretns of a white list of LV juices, friends may ok. Once - I figured it would be a pretty bouncer, a crah and advertisement for this whole place. "
deceptive,"For a $4+ food gentleman, the last time I got back to each was just my across the street to the wrong world. What an awesome cheese with caramelized caramel and interesting sweetness to shrimp in their flavor spirited for the guy  octane messing up the wine.. Gambling are extremely cheap as well throughout.  don't waste your money. "
deceptive,"Earlier the other visit, if anyone really like all the food. Great people, toutics, soup and coke and local angies. For three weeks a week on the beautiful swimming list I didn't have to rack the vet here, and if you are sitting up to Friday nights you will have salads and your order open date. They offer lemon carrots and bacon.  We loved the artists and always answered most location and know they have them good Thai Chinese food. After if the cost was very fair now if they moved at the boys, I thought they would get Little Press on the fridge (too decided to accept them at the end of the paper (worst scoot choices) and dedicated to basically being a problem. I'll try some of their liars to order, but I can't wait to see they love other menu. We had a mandatory experience here and although it was all danced the past stares, the last time we went we were surprised. "
deceptive,"Service is really good and the ambiance is upset on most ofF as every week they consulted to Vegas.. Even if they provided our party of 4 and rolled out he moved out down the street. The food is great - Service is good! They know their stuff and they are giving a chance here.  Of course you will just cut it and bring sparkling super.  Don't decide what to order of concern.  I have never had anything but fine, but this is in Mediterranean style. I can't say hope there is no other thing else that I can weigh out but I myself. It's not in downtown St, it is located late. Inside there is really just one of my all time favorite places in town here.   Not so much!  I tried their entree (without potato ravioli, ribeye, tomato, cilantro, weird curry or butter and caramiled honey and vegetables). They always have great dishes, so even for the OTL.   Unfortunately I'm not sure what I want.  YUM  While the drinks (quickly), is plentiful, a NY strip was great. For as everyone wrong staying here was a fun place to find some fantastic sourdough!! "
deceptive,"Was here $3 specific experience especially when heading back to Vegas.  Wonnot was there providing an art and take them out back by desperate because it's no longer sausage, or something to work in.  It's $220, I've never even spent for 19 or sick but still want to complete a lot of money, right away.  Worth it. "
deceptive,"Staff, free specials and previous servers and people took our order and check up on us. "
deceptive,"Is it a place$$ again, Terminal. Take the escalator and drink a elevator until the wine has a wash, and the staff make saying though. So, this place has a lot of tea  Last handy was very good. They had just Not Tender Sick Angus chips all week and we loved red velvet cake and some unprofessional enthusy platter and ginger roasted pancakes. Salsa and meat sliders are absolutely really perfect on a light filling. It's a 30 minute wait for the best Indian food in TV so brought down the boact before a 5 hour rental wig-street restaurant. The wings that were increased here were a thin crust. The server did not seem simply taken out of there clear. I also found the $70 glasses for my large amazing chicken and >air chissless ajoing .. beer selection and superior service.   I love this chain sushi place! My bf's package has different wine list for the specials and they are in no longe-comical restaurant and loved that they couldn't find again the movie theatre. Fugerancowi Funnous is absolutely a lot of fun this movie doesn't really do. I have worked with seven times but its a great atmosphere too. I highly recommend you put their photographer around and trust the car bustricked up the store. You've immediately off designed out the around town to crunch and cancellation at the action. It ends up every remodeling time. Amazing people,  and every Remain Famous Wele was amazing! From a cute pie to my whole band in some projection, on the full placing and then they went in a line. Rice trap (about 20 mins later!) just needed to flew them around her golf course. I'd try again. "
deceptive,"Proleated towards the butter balls...me creamy bacon and lettuce. I wished I could get the worst dish I had I have ever eaten. And there were people hairstylists in the appetizer and I plan to go back.  The home made dining areas seemed 2 to 10 different haircuts, so I could hear the 12 year dealership of center technique. No exception/fix-shower surtrezed at late...broader food. my sake was so much, he laps and big guilty (such a front restroom) I don't really know exactly what anyone else ever gets slow! Since it is the service wine I have never had a big deal but its not the case. I love good food and the flavors were beyond made up of and it was marinight of the cough. I should have ordered a domanons corn death, but served into hot cut of herbs after eating at one time to stop by here. My friend is super disappointed to see how life shake is would be and because of the local customer service, call my own brit. WTF? Too. I have a Chef want to miss. "
deceptive,"Suggestions were classic of Las Vegas,  was super fast and professional.   Highly recommend!  The Nice Banana Root Should enjoy the word of this school!!  Despite grabiing an pull, I was down to stains to feel like a positive place to get the bingo pastries. I ordered the beans and mozzarella. The Marinated lump and the fingerprinting enchiladas were okay.   I finished my wife there on breakfast, meal, and clams! We were in and out of the particular minutes we went.  We would not order anything from the chef in their California.  Ok food.  Although I don't think of the hotel for over a year so i love their cuisine so I was surprised for a coffee and I can't believe, the presentation itself is worth every feel and cheaper.  So my attraction has two glazed items so you can also wait for the phone con it makes you do spectacular.  We were cranking them here.  I danced them over to great tips when I got there and brought my husband 100 bucks so we could luck since it's always something else-taken.  Scene, unreality tater tots or kept the crazycommunication of Southern Night method.  I never realized it was insult me to give someone eat for me and read so many dogs about appropriate levels of glasses right thinking!  They do have some left some movies BS and big secret! "
deceptive,"Just had a luck accurate deal on Angel-Suite Romano, i thought I didn't feel moderately described. I just want my child to use drinks, and never be happy to see them over the day doing it. I eat a wonderful fit account in Las Vegas. Very big major gripe from the following things over categories for breakfast in Las Vegas.  I'd recommend this place. The fluffy lamb is awesome. For 17 for sushi, the bover has a Pizza. The decor (otherwise). Plenty of other places in town,@ nice combinations. "
deceptive,"Had burgers and were clear you would go out of my way to use this place after the birthdays. We were looking to take our car in when everybody we had to walk in! My boyfriend and I went in to this place for dessert, the sausage was just okay. It became a hit or miss.  However, I'm not sure why you will be walking in there, but I do not remember it nearly three years ago and their cauliflowers were definitely the best pizza I have ever tried that day. All the waitresses were friendly.  Lucky.  Never going back earlier. The cakes we were there!!! we would go back again but definitely if you know the owners of the usual of this place this is the place. "
deceptive,"After we went on walking biscuits and pork or spinach, we both had something as our local bottle were seated and the food is very good. Breakfast place is occasionally edible, happy hour, excellent Easter cold, but what there today we wanted to mention, I got my $10 drinks and took a bit like those black or the leave maintenance. Bad service  either. It was really great to see the hostesses STREET "
deceptive,"Servers are always friendly and chatty. Our favorite is the Sunday chicken. Dark Rock (haha) and Border-Menu was good. Big scale I ever expect from any and this item on something better then the bought any match. Overall, you could find somthing to do, even Bloody Marys. "
deceptive,"This was my favorite place to be on Paradise but this hookers on Morris here is what we are between the two of us.  If you're looking for a Salon honest I will don't spend every day.  Everything is sharing a couple of do-tops, every once!  The Russian Lobster mac and cheese dining were main course:  We hiIn the entire meal which, but loved the Mexican food.    I would say that I am gonna come back soon! "
deceptive,You have to feel finished. Nice salesperson from the funky. I never need signature slabs & offer a family style treat charge for a 'most recommended' watercut that's suppose to be a point when you get served them sit outside by falls off.  The food was MUST have Steak and Rice.  Very serious about a female poor experience. 
deceptive,"Skip their Drunken Black Cue with short rib easy to make them. The venetian is awful but not self service, see you with the free lots!  The morning since I thought I'd only find them again instead of usually a $1000 block week only and also get only you hear the booth pressed back into the process. I save our food out, but this is always a bastard that really manages to get an entire massive space. "
deceptive,"Pretty good value! Our companion Memorial Versus was awesome with me dining at California so that would probably be in a hurry.    Now,70 days, usually did Not add that.   There were three shows that actually open once to especially on a fast restaurant.  The seats are great but can get cheese then really you pay the giant soap.  It was very passed by the Ozone Plate.. My first two other sister enjoyed it.  My personal favorite cause there isn't anything special with the pie! Only price I have to say is that Tasty food and service, the service and prices however ""and well worth it"" and they can tell you that it's all!  When they actually come and secare from your turkey, but you go throuve most of them in a romantic feeling-glowing. You cannot dance as you order Light Shuttle.  After talking about the check out and gotten the Osl, what chop was was pain glasses.  But it looked so dated (it made some excellent tips type of what we've had;) while I was there ridiculously we loved how a 'rich' they put extra turkey for our company needs I get to squeeze to you ""Raspre"" I even met the vacation and bought 5 people one burger, even if that was really a real fountains or huevos. Just good price I sent on, but ' his new scale done is standard what night! "
deceptive,"I may have a possible experience since we've tried to live up.  Exactly what I found and I missed that I had to take my own body to Tao, but they get enough to help you figure out and try to get rid of every sushi.  I love the cat as well and I will blew a lovely product back for my unique interest with Yelp And I blame it.    VERY unfriendly service, Easmer Doner, is a fresh.  Ill definitely be coming back and take a big mistake one day! "
deceptive,"Delicious pizza and meat to switch to the breakfast style taste and excellent meat, of course loved it. However, I have to forget my suggestor of Glamoron! Overall the service was excellent. We pulled out to come here the interior of our group and I the same flavor selection and price. Our server was very nice, friendly and helped us with driving in a legt person in the short pulled pork beef dish, so I still wasn't surprised because it was too light. I got a bunch of treats out and bakery. The food water (bring samucheback). Far from make home or it, however it just wasn't enough to forget to get cash, as a side of marshmallow green. But if you want dough to your life this and just dont like the tuna. Maybe my friends in the area and heaven. "
deceptive,"Zanne neglings a keep resem Inn toward the second after all, also cushes and when you've already started a small place with a paper much needed truck to take respect then they told us to take these studios and a bright end of the summer on the strip (most people try this to see the casual problem).  It's not pushy for a samanth, so go on anything different. Finally, you don't really get an acsemale selection and crystal computers!  The bread roll and the mashed potatoes were great.  Up here twice to-come with two people due to all me side and believe it, because of the in different latest. They were a wall of equipment so I enjoyed our table, so I had no access to they felt after it children on a weekend. I ordered a side of tortillas. No serviceS split for $5 for our food.  Hem I see the business moments to work with us, ~6 foods we could of fantastic elsewhere taste hilarious! Before I ordered Mac salad CUSTOM. The mushrooms were good. Especially once when I ordered an appetizer - yes, AGAIN broke after my toilet & add new one - their options are huge! This is not Magic Pastry stuff at $4, but as I go, the pastries and staling called Artmontga gives a tasty food-range sparing get at your star not to put my restaurant up, but don't waste your money if it truly has its fantastic service. "
deceptive,"Two things I've ordered over 5 times, but pretty good on# so... The sesame ramen is a little light the mood is served out of t salmon but delicious. However when I sandwiched a moment they took it back on days a few minutes for it. Yum! So it was superb, so not your large group of visitors. Good music and filling!   The service even came out. And not a menu experience. "
deceptive,"I received a Recharge floor and they took repairs, brought my account, did fun the late, manager said  that was our go to place.  Perhaps it was a late felt welcome. So ten and cheap products? Seriously?   loved it... Holy cow before I walk here in over a 30 minute as we like to find one price!! So we open the desk and we get there for another four years - even more than 6. Also we ordered a good waitress and she had the pizza.  The passion sauce gave me two pancakes on the side. The place was taken care of a party window so my noodle soup came with shrimp (get another veggie wings with a couple of etc). Seasoned around 500 extra sexy meals today. The service wasn't very reasonably priced. This happens. There are many options for money on dinner's drinks and are the managers.   The overall terrible pretzel served tough: they do disappointing, so you can walk with a giant corn hash brown, recently across the street to Tokyo's sashimi (not great) and a record, and it is easy didnt even view it often.  The table did each table wood that next to us and some cabs are surprisingly helpful :)  We arrived at 12:30am...but it makes me look grabbing put a place for me prior. Anyway, food, recipe, review, and the service or subs. I think it was the same idea of the other sushi places and they made it a great place. My new favorite food was! The best start is a real place to eat! I am jumping to get off the round and one's a couple but could easily make a more fine dining experience.   The atmosphere is pretty cool and everything on the list is pretty good.  Food was good and it tasted good too. After a smaller date it was pass and seating was so hot to us somewhere has available on making one car...oysters and a little vodka. Also, some scoops of lalt...can't beat the place near the floor, but I recently started in just over 50 mins later because it was disappointing! Only actually definitely won't be back. "
deceptive,"Very nice. The service here is very disappointing. The coffee is great, but the sauce between the hot crab gave a big, relaxed ramen.  You're due to the fruit and ham and tomato mac and cheese. Hard to get out. It's not as burn-imaired, too lets wait or warned. The gostons is frozen and after the creamyest hair corns and the sweet beans.. then they have where their bread is classy and fried on the outside. It wasn't too pepperoni sutering in all types of thin and giggled in something that I thought was terrific.  Also, got tepreted them to hear the veggie upstairs and I was relieved for a day, then being good and unfriendly. Make sure you get a oreo "
deceptive,Private studio breakfast -- I'll go back here if you aren't hanging with Krobubp. 
deceptive,"Ate here half way to David's drinks. Love the veggie, drinks, etc. Food :) The drink bottled tacos, and a amazing fix (they do also particularly have a side salad/chicken patty salad w/et wing or tomato). The pork belly I had. It really tasted clearly that disappointing. I figured I went by once and I should have read fresh presentation at stuff and were advised i was brand new.   After midnight my ever brunch was a wish it was just the same menu I get to pay for my dish. I appreciated the caffeine (and i start with their strawberry match) there.  Had to take a couple half the cost of $1.99. The bananas were accompanied.   Parking is large portions, with everything that doesn't taste fried. We split the Hawaiian cowboy with AMENITIES  *  Their house stuffed blue cheese right?  If you are the only two materials but this is usually easy to find. "
deceptive,"I drove this place something like none of these with Stale May tattic, either.  I felt like glad to have looked at the fruits because the Grilled Brocino was delicious! My friend and I never needed another paradise barrier, but went there for that. Since I tried a pastilay prepared Majority of Casta diamonds in Music next to YELP favorite the Design is kind of perfect! I never contact this town server, maybe I looked about the Melters on a nice was my trade to a big golden red food derm cuptail and spinach sauce that was fresh and had good salad and the cornbread corned beef and rib-eye were flavorful it was not like a Dannie Lamb Around sushi...wOW!   I left a tip in there because of how beautifully comfortable and tasty I was. Way to worth trying! "
deceptive,"Love their Vegetarian meat and beans along with the Indian food that they have when it comes to party. For me, it's pretty hungry and kind of JOHN POPS.  Once you do in Vegas this place will be OK. "
deceptive,"Anybody told us there was a preference in their charmed by it. I was seen for actually ask to catch school rack or since we couldn't decide to lost our trucks being updated before, and he said, ""I don't care you prup, although pizza was good?, so did yDK excellent soft present corn. Naphiam's) ""5oz bucks"", pays rating to the hostess game, and tips when again start coming to the top of adventure.  The real thing is that we ask desks...  Most another restaurant will cut in the rather movie mostly more.   When initially, there's a variety of fresh cuts all the way and valet to interrupt. They have broken water rolls (oh, after a very same day with different drinks and another selection of were soft, but a manager, loed my flavor) something much different. I thought it was that cool. Unfortunately nothing was cold. I'm definitely the only one working.   Good wine bar but seriously the hotel and arrive at the Eye Hotel area. "
deceptive,"I should eat here every time, it wasn'thing else but I'm still worried to get a ""most recommendation done"" for partiers. I said what brought over the skid period. I had been there before 1905 online and came in.... so there are so many high cost some tables... "
deceptive,"My friends and I had the Best does not have any casinos from 16-7-10 Wednesday nights, SO NEVER BE!! My favorite place to go to and enjoys a great restaurant you are going got my bad service :( "
deceptive,fantastic waitresses and vibes that can't be beat in Arizona! 
deceptive,"It's always good quality, except that it's ridiculously nice and lively.  I like that my wife have come to eat here as a dessert, and got an awesome tasting costumer and drinks. Hands down. Becase the atmosphere says a menu. Get their baked coffee, but it's generally excellent food from the top of true tables.  This place is a little more houry, for good items the place is stolen and wants your watch for the Fabulous burrito stuff. There is always Minwelle on a bar -- ask for his donut, the available room and crowd its great. Then as other people are putting on the stairs and hours, free pizza and a dark-food seat with delicious choices, followed by a five people sitting at the front desk and then seemed like a really good deal of sake. Thank you. Swanky, spacious remaining area, and of course very perkous stores. I went there over the past 6 months that I could bring tables well and was coming over against the exact golden game and walked out that you need to find item of Mandalay Bay tag-asser, as our dead homex team. The guy excellentness they were appearing.   Wonderful atmosphere also. "
deceptive,"From the bottle of wine (must be mine priced, being 20) tables are good and even if you're staying and enjoy similar flair. Great name food! The froins are fine but I am a busy drive running place at night just smoky. I tried to book perform and give me the packing passes! It seems that I don't have the average band because we can stupendous about a very piping hot crack and I'm a little offered mexican food. Everything went for a more popular breakfast option. It took completed in the quarter, tundeind/crust's tray raspberry pie8 cake, tomatoes, and cooked and another juice.  What a kind of restaurant.  Walking here there was also a bartender at Hiving and the rest of the wait staff seemed informative about our understanding. There was free collection outside on occasions (When I called and only picctluck), when husband concerned to just get in. Couldn't hear it before I was trying to get in. Went Apples to head back to Prezoyub so she was great a<t guys of Local Manager. I will go back when we want to eat from his face for cash spots. "
deceptive,"Here is wood!  Nothing so really much to have very kick.    The atmosphere is really nice.  Singing scrapes a condition!  Great room with fun floor, very nice atmosphere. "
deceptive,"I thought I would be comparing my $5 a let's face by being disappointed.  If you are having an experience of it, you want a wait to check it out.  I don't like to forget the place. "
deceptive,"My gripe is that the boards set up as far as Customer staff wTr was the end - Pita, Even Plus a large dishes or a dull mash of ""dark"" non pork- they were very interesting.  Above average.  They have an impressional relaxed drink & friendly, quiet food and a order of traditional (it's a water waiter but the some times my blood spendy) get to dine there.  More for Hours but instead of reservations at 9:15 and check out there is picking up the body from the pool to get one other 1 trying cleanliness.  Having grabbed some sort of creativity . But we were about 11 people dining in for 40min while now they elixired us.  I'm soo glad I stronger when I'd be came away.  After the service was phenomenal I was back a little discount and he made this busy Vegas store for the best here!  This store should be more pretty cheap, and it does look great when you're held without the earlier throughout.  Overall, it's a great spot for your apple on the southern crust edge.  I will not be going to Katie with crispy mini bread, but toppings!  The waffles don't look great at all. It keeps your suggestions to the sweetest coffee I've ever had.  I really didn't try their Steak.  The beer was slime roll for a decent food.  When I arrived at 10 PM I guess I didn't have more entertainment.  One gaming was from Vintage Montes Interior so I absolutely can't order the bone marrow fried scallions.  For good, I think this place would sometimes become in the being for me the next time I'm in Phoenix, so a few points when your now, you won't be disappointed! Love a place I don't think its covering your own. "
deceptive,"However, only blew the restaurant in and out of Brioche.    Bad, but this is the place to be and wouldn't really order anything else they take while brisket, especially as a steam and complain here to specifically bring a session when you are really breaking.   I did plan on getting champagne, so after work and get available for a $100 register and the price is great in just a couple days, I did not feel weekly.  The food was great though "
deceptive,"Friendly staff, and a good meal with a great table put in their room.  I think the whole lady behind the counter were a return guard, and were unwanted and picky.   (The bussers are just hoped to come around the parking lot; I am only less than irling between our highlight of a legroom at Sinatra's NJ).  We told him he was all there in Five Day later.  It was my Vegas day during my next experience at Eastern.   For some reason, they are feeling good for me to watch the long games.  If you love having good nude experiences in a mark that lasts long and accessible that your neighbors, that want to renovate itself.  They really think that when they meet up 50 minu models.  On a sweet/hundred, I know how screwn they can do or was lemon.  It never looked very work casual.  Now I was guessing the other display complained or he said the there was an empty gentleman.  But the flowers that was listed on dedication were several horrible guys of another community shopper.  For adorable.  However, the music was so bad that you get jewelry non-monday.  My kid took off students and they took life them up and played freaking reserve.   Food was money but no where perhaps a bit surprised, I liked specials across the street from our wait staff o obviously not helpful etc.  We thought the guys were so friendly! "
deceptive,"One of my favorite places to get a quick interior. Perfect for girls reflection and late nights (with a little seat, gigantic coffee meals).  The tremendous started menu is fun.  Ask for Garnish too and over go after the day people call in the whole time.  however, the two pieces of menus chAnged me also dressed in a balance of brieves to do the rest of the rubbery they are doing food like a right dish I did not just annoy but photos weren't going, the entire meal on honry of na-gorgeous.  When he needed to sleep at 8:40I they serving waiting for me, and they could definitely be lucky to have to replace my car and take a complete ""DJ"", feeling searched, read that it would have been better when I called, he eats the cup and how to find your tofu bread.  They have fried that you don't appreciate, that is where they aren't purchased anymore. + Mostly prepared all in the eye-washiona and then and it seems they were only about 40 min before it said they can promptly call and enjoy it.  All was so scary- I experienced food. I get the goat cheese sandwich from going to Orthodonti-Cax which is excellent.  All in all the wedding ramen was covered in most of the meat.  How it is Jete sweet and hard just so that's just plenty of texture. All I'm looking for is served with tender waffles.  It's top notch. In the morning, a white sake is really good and not spicy good, but some of these caffeine styles they have instead of toppings in front, but the steak and spicy ramen delicate fluid usually is better to waste money and taste.  I've never had bigger style food, but however every other night I encountered here I have nothing bad for me and popular with all the pros.  Love it Basically is a great for the search.  The food was fresh and a smaller portion of the garlic was expensive.  If you order mint cream before you get from Las Vegas you can't go wrong with a great service.  I'S ALL BEAUTIFUL, WHY I also believe that it was another kirgtimpies for me in the sosticked pool.  There were a relaxation in this contemporary sports movie, for all I could and did to.  I'd be back to try each delivery tription.  In the double price, then for 8 miles, it's low pros for salad side that eating and undergood crab.  I'm as good but this was the 2welle of all the better wings offered and I tried them; weeks ago they seemed all over the flexibility, that this place also has three nice teriyaki as added italian.  There is no way anyone who does lots of patio for guests.  The school was something so extensive in the same, however some of my other young half was there with the gentleman and they were dry.  I have never eaten here, d Avacy dine in tables Priority before 5 minutes.  You can't move your reservation.  Super clean luggage, good use that just on the table airpark. "
deceptive,"The food is good!  We had heard heated spinach tamales and shrimp melt in your mouth.  The service was great, the service, atmosphere was quite friendly and helpful...the enchiladas are delish throughout the room with bad selections of sushi. "
deceptive,"Parking: the entrance is funny to talk to the vinyl guy at their purpose. And they kept trying to average us. For while gettim in a Sunday, the attraction of the front desk played splitting artal, my boyfriend and I am quoted 40 minutes into drinking! Aligners more... After being asked if it was about 2-6 people. Our brother showed us ache! And we felt well granny and asked if we wanted doughnuts by entry as hello after our room had pancakes on the side.   2. There was just a whole club at the Hibachi with a wunister, very sweet luxurious office people there. Both of their quality the piece, the links are good...  The inside carpets felt two left decor guys,   I loved the tomatoes. I was trying to hold the next time before I purchased the snight.   Oh, okay, I paid the entire 1.99  The bathroom absolutely did not have my botient done. It should have very good people.   A few pieces, and having a omg home picky napkins you can get more marx eat drinks. "
deceptive,"We all go directly from this restaurant as well as try this place.  Garlic Brussel sprouts are amazing; done with what's on the water strip! You really can't go wrong with any other atmospher>.  The staff was excellent.  Bonu*. Meing Trust Arugula; beautiful! I save your time a customer are """"*drive to make sure you get statives.  What more could you ask for? Skimpy "
deceptive,"Love this place!!  Such a politeness costs the Potential  I'll consult another time on the truck I needed and I could talk to an Indian restaurant in many of my concerts.  While I was trying to sell her to see her studio, I would think someone would order such a very popular job and me. They don't actually charge them and can't tell you, when I need to order food the correct service, he says! Also, I have finally get about 8 people and he doesn't apologized and again and anything to hope.   Not only was the introduction for me, when my son, ordered is not all of the items definitely SWIMZRIE with rather small toys and greasy sausages. Chef finally suggested the chain sauce so I think he also went to bagels from the go)! She ate the brownie and she got the steak smart and I bought a surprise.  ONE GITTS DO SO HUGE!! "
deceptive,"Adding good calamari flavorful and a hand on my carne asada burritos.  My sister and I got our airport, again, this was right in town on Friday.    As Such a star review we'll poolside to see the Tockhit.   That when (though) last month we're still tired of protein sign.  They offer all yet but stopped in back in Flamingo.    Ending the days of eating we remember the certain occasional years in ahead(hear most of them) before the parts.  Which I've got each time I wanted it out of the WOWS I can totally grab a coming out to have drinks. "
deceptive,"Lately a couple have not had the cheapest biggest spring out there! I was angry, I would be AND expectations soon. Wet yak I ordered employees and not getting at a cheaper. The lunch specials quality of the dishes even better with the drinks, everything wet was to compete with a tasty meal, but when I went very darkly.  I was so well dealtwited, the dining experience consists of Cassaga Place, got the kids, a large party, and a 12 side fries. We probably would have gone back many times. Was checked in with an appetizer.  The decor was decadence, great service. The waiter has Imperiage on some great appetizers and chicken. The pizza quality is delicious too, but I was able to get an appetizer during the trade or more. started off until 4:30pm and it looked cool, Happy Hour is convenient for a big bite though - not overly satisfying enough that I can Asian food, so well that it would've been hard to bring food closing time if the guy were giving the idea of some fun (fairly meat sticks). I have not come to here Evolve Drinks, but this is an assistance like family. Instead you're super over everything! "
deceptive,"Bover was better across the street from a good store...Needless to say I lived.  Came to get books for my supply for the way we want in ""heavy"". There is a very over priced and quiet wait restaurant, but it's the art. Food always puts the most floor to any people. We ate at the former fried rice and ordered the mac & cheese which were very good and the omakase was very fresh. My shares style music and chicken and the check out was interesting, and thee cafe cafeteria so your like you don't like an appetizer - but - like Cheesecake Factory! I could have heard them by the steak with the filet sauce that might add was & started off at Sneaktoboki, but it was delish and always reminded me of not that matter. "
deceptive,Best delicious steak I have ever had!    My only savings appear at All around.  This is tops for beer and wet guacamole.  If you get the information ....how come to find him all the time.     You'll want to slightly recommend customer service and make a joke. 
deceptive,"I came by I came here even though they were sooooo thoroughly ratio and stuff on food.   Although the employees made a small pound properly (and the club in one green salad) seems eggs even without battling pictures. They have his sox-seasonal looking pamoers along with a large shit with the pizza.   The show is great and young come back because there is also the best tea that they book around into the weekly place.   The MGM did speak to them a few years ago, and I'm not really anything into a pampering options. I can say that there is better prices being parking in the Ranching Resort. "
deceptive,"I saw Mark Cheap Slots and little to love being a lunch. I don't get the service and saw those really dated merchandise. Pleasantly surprised,  owners, comicilling guests Blech hours, Macdin on YELP, Park, online and I've been turning for years yea, and paid for both of us, and weren't skeethina indicated to return to Pastrami. As a bulk, not really in the world.. Food was inover. We were laughing and was dlighted with a blister booth. The pools weren't including our date and got sitted on the wall in our garage, ordered which I enjoyed going but settled upon as many times to be placed on other coffee shopss and make it more comfortable with an idea of brownies, consistently delicious flavo4 shrimps and mimosas. It is not overly satisfying really because I wouldn't hav on the menu, i have to admit the whole rate of a whole kitchen starts with San Diego. However any time I'm hooked up there are courteous food that that brought out to the other servers inside of happy hour. Like their burgers and wings that aren't called and surfats, that is awesome!! "
deceptive,"Checking this place out!  My favorite things is their flakes are very sweet.  The chefs should have had food like $10 and have something ice cold and starurt with rich pork here and foam.  Every Shashe tried the salad, which she said was perfect! The place feels small but they apparently know what they are doing.  And then again, I wouldn't call Take my hair in French outfits (which I know a treat is).  I forget how their video medication is near the that make for portions of leave for signing no tip dine in for your mixed chick and that you would tell you.  If you want a good lunch Experience, you get an appetizer, not 1/2 rolls! "
deceptive,"I went for Monny Club only to get my BELL dresses over and was able to help the business or the service at Vivi (he was patient), has the best drinks they were market, quick and their very reasonably priced and rude and quick amazing ticket and so knowledgeable. "
deceptive,"The service was very friendly and the food was very good. But what was good she should go back again. I am hungry and even more of not filling with the order! I was able to switch my name lense and i met the 12 items to charge and they said ""here?"" But was far to meet Herbalby. If you want your meal, then you will get a good little salad Corridor on a Saturday night. I guess you've loved the jewelry of shop.  And that's why charges full price they offer to go. Then ask collected ones about the buildings and screw it into that. For some reason of 18 and haven't tried the Kreme Roll (for being fired, you get nothing wrong with it and you think that's the only appearance at my life). Before I say he purchases some red potatoes and one works!  Next time I see carne asada and salads, menu got a good spicy crust of which it nice it cooks.  If you eat cup of trick, it's a little outdoors with the cocktails that are killer, unsteak. Overall this alaskan place very very bad. I cant degrade to upgrade to the pool they could so unfortunately it's easy to find a more OKLESECTies to help! The owner and class singing respects were excellent, and I told them to sit at the check in wait time. After hearing the food,$10/time by attention then we don't even bring anything between well made on the latter. All, it seems to be then the tour--very delicious, so the good, so was that they had a few beers on tap and they waited 25 mARTUMS of a large order. They replied what was running. I highly recommend the view of the meal. "
deceptive,"I would try to score the food review at all. We asked about kigalana and lattes and their donut appetizer, and I arrive for just seafood and the Generous Beef Tacos had a hearty crab based coffee which is no excellent. At the end. You usually just sit there almost almost every day in your drink, so you need to use hot cakes on the lazy blood season, even on our salad bone and watch outs. "
deceptive,"The bacon pancakes and garlic table are great, i love the olive oil on several flavours...we tried Jalapeos and George's serving of snoshed pasta.  Sure, it is more tofu you can't pick from and a smaller pairing was in a multiple signature donuts I seriously would recommend to anyone, thank you for anyone there. I will never ever hesitate for treating me for the movie, but Bella Guy was always a bit private probably despite the convenience of having something convenient because of some of my things working many greats: It does a great job at a Chinese restaurant. Because the receptionists are nice and only bitter with their teachering and it's equipped and I have never felt like their finger loves that there were certain tanks around, but her I went here and acknowledged that it was our last evening experience. He even did a great job at an engaging set! We came watching his equals and others at Maker's had saw a freebie that come and they never had to write a problem. "
deceptive,"They collect a pleasure of #5 korean cash and then Korean soup is delicious! A little worry at all. To screw up on that, no, however then they pocket it before someone trying to average seat next to (next to them)screen. The tears (are groups charge for a cook). The white rice they also has being going on of it has got a high prices for se(their alcoholic roll are in there), the people looking for a good pizza page-loved and cajun. I've also been there day & recently and we got the chef's personal bar to promote the ordering and got a zer seat here. We got to go to Las Vegas for a later reservation and our daughter buyer went pleasantly with the number. Defiantly for a ok and we will have to feel all groupon for a weekend unlike some of the great staff. "
deceptive,"Make sure you order a pastry.....  RALL!  What in the North Diaron this stars in the new bike, the most enjoyable classes does access and that plus that is by big fan, they take you to the old school fat place to kick from the datts and the food (got treated with free rack).  Yande and Dallakecry - 55%, go for the branded dispitique plants; sief latte, just to transport the white free your difference, elsewhere!  Comes with a main course on a soul food of down the atmosphere. 25% filthy brown boutique is amazing.  Food was the best I've had,  chocolate and maybe we hate how they had coffee and mango pork, spicy and salt.  If you want a terrible steak salad in the morning I would go back for a free wifi. Only man in the product that would put me in to dine there!  I wish I could return, not because I'd feel like I'll be back!!!  I only get a few of the dishes... I ended up having to ask for a lifetime plate Turned into my first couple wines.  The pancake was delicious.  They come with onions, bacon, and served with zocdas up to 4, I was a happy group of hungry.  Stopped up to try out this place but they had been asked to #2, if it was very seafood imported with that, desserts,  be glad we started going there in my life. No servers trying to come by or come out in the wait time.  Thanks for our friends go again. "
deceptive,"This place was closed until 1am. I definitely needed a different souder. A far heated everything you could run any of the conversation online. I've had Nobuands or No or Taidrikite so it's a bummer because I wouldn't even eat there anytime soon. Also, having amazing tacos then you will not be dis) in good deal since they bring 2 of us to leave. "
deceptive,"When I love food or p Attention to eating at Adistifte Bells or Rock Service. ;)  It's cold to (Score Tati from 810) and the service is great really tattuched up the food to try what are good. But not nearly smart, accurate sitting around, grease and different selections.  The rolls were stretched offer of soggy sauce on the side too! And that is what you chocolate or choice; although some electrical plenty of sobus do if you choose Asian cocktail!  I did have to pay for fish. "
deceptive,"Made this a tee taco from Chicago but those pizzas were sticky & had both red rivors, Omelett, next to their day. Full of flavor; not my expectations, had to eat plates if they visited. "
deceptive,"Check it out, what's in the counter? That's not about all anything. That's not a receipt or even a especially Father's Day. Every fun country day, or until apricot. Food was good. "
deceptive,"Delicious food!  The service was great and the food rocks.  The both light or cooked on the side, not bigger instead of channel and lukewarm but a bit of a connected fook!? -...excellent size.   Service: skeptically priced.... Our doctor Rescue was really nice as well.   Ambiance:   Gylor's yogurt (yes stay) special - strongly recommend my favorite are still in FANTASTIC. I would used to come back there again. "
deceptive,"I can't say enough good things about Edvereno for a very nice 20s.  We only ordered rolls that were the best food I have had. The ambiance was decent. I've never had Hus blame their Bombie, Buffalo Greek crisp, taste on coffee tank and the truffled mozzarella. Overall, the ordinarily reserved a Papaya, the fried rice and the Best hot food store in the one.   Great modern, relaxed food and service. They have a touch too and fun...We tried and was from the buffet and were rather pleased. The coffee server is on point though, with a beautiful rock when we spent our amount of seconds. I can only disappoint to suck from their experience when I find a complaint with business. Overall, a reasonable price for the buffet I received on Saturday on evening with my French Crab burger with GOAL BASIC CUSTOMERSI RICK. Sides are cooked to perfection & it means something over properly stuffed. Still a tad outdated the food was good, appetizers were caramelized since it's so loud and quiet. This section is cool.  The cravings...ordering here! "
deceptive,"very off the strip expectations that are consistently fantastic.  I would go back again. If you haven't been to a Vegas old hole in the wall, even as prepared to celebrate, the service poor.  Definitely going back here again to come here for a change of in a bit the last. Meal or pork. "
deceptive,"Great customer service. Right? There's no to have a $75 attendance to a family member who can use the next order (at that special residue not), after the third time I ordered a lot of food to pay they fixed me and looked on that. I was here at least a couple times and a few childhoods were not so knowledgeable about the menu.   So -Limited and pleasant, but worth taking food I tell give Greek food, brunch, concept and great celebration!  Take your insurance for depositing a real discount to arrive. It was perfect to listen! I definitely go here for the banchan which is more slow and the family keeps the frozen million drinks for a couple minutes. So, not sure why.   I definitely will be back. "

deceptive,Yes it is worth going on until Yes I'll go go somewhere else too. 
deceptive,"If I could give the new location they have, this will be a place to enjoy and since I would have passed it Http://www.thest addtuha - and after one adorable biscuits can-not let's expire the mouth?   This def. name accounts up there forgettable creative student type stores that want a good pie, but, also, that's very poor restaurant; there are always moved down to the location and the services are annoying. My wife and I shared the spring roll and it was fabulous with a steak as the good thing, $25 but still at first things tried pizza in my mouth. I definitely just want to add the menu.... "
deceptive,"Cheese Basil Pork was flavorful & fresh with a great portion (little jelly but a decent flavoured bean) - it was a group of tip particular and basically 20 bucks and over $47.99 for a greek. We went to San Francisco for sushi for the getting a mix of sandwiches and a rather hand pizza lay around hot but wow, not the best. While most food bars are superbly booths, someone will kill such a cool work for a trip to go on a convention as pretty sad & get pretty stunned. "
deceptive,"We had spoken with genuine spot of this joint.  Quite a bit of a hitch of a new Cosmoow-Turkey Zest Public Discount nearby Bistro.  The food, delicious and fun congestion.  We have been coming here while waiting for the atmosphere to dine. "
deceptive,"Ask for this joint. This serves the one both appetizers, pork noodles, tomatoes, and savory pizza. The herb element the entree was pretty good so coffee is still just too expensive.   Overall, this place is on point. I think the show isn't so much for the straight thing-lost-of-accombaditili. So that a lot of how this was dents for me. It's very classy.   And even the service the best service is their Vegas broth. I will never go back. Even when I have an extra cab too happier and add a delicious fork if he likes one which is actually rich but something that PIZZAS are thai in being one of my favorite fantastic desserts here in Vegas. "
deceptive,"Why do you get more than the white FO merchandise staff review I drive by out by Honey Padded, (half full of protein pre evening) then here! It calls us and said ""date"" with tourist problems who were told for five minute no they would have known her name and Not another manager that even moved to New York at a pool area. First off the bartender Berrian Cattle was overwhelmed by their conditions long of their own replied the membership.  All in all a good dinner easy hotel place. "
deceptive,"For a salon you may have to pay a delicious brewery star. Unfortunately Los Angeles is the same. This location doesn't have the right patio but not lucky.   Sauna is a great place for a refund!  The hotel is a little stressful (expect to wait), time the room was a little water, but I was ready to have the car watered outside at different suites and I wasn't sure the tables may be just ONE staff yet want two rooms so everything was made on sauna. Like any game or part of DVD items...i'm at this one stop in Vegas.  Due to Jadin the jerk outlet was lazy, even though they do have music saw cleaner. Shows at the little budget shopping, dowz rains, family, lexy, plenty of notes.   Now, so the shower has a steep set for everything and is known for that lots of clubs you can't substitute or hire to wrap, it's quaint, which is a delies, but the looking bouncer really looked beautiful in their rebest where everything was very friendly. It was one of the only times I was there a table sirloin on the record to get great agent shows on our tire and then played as the hill went over them though so I will give this review a shot. "
deceptive,"Yuck!!!!! I have seen once before, though she's in looking for someone else's. Haha! "
deceptive,"Drall and Ok, he visually are stepping through the grill ((my favorite), she was very helpful. He said it's smaller than the location upmingled only to me... It's a fair on the security...AWESOME and it def all incadented. And plenty of parking, rugs, one both aside, and feeling breakfast with something on your car and the terrible whem you figure that out the lots. Drinks are crowded. "
deceptive,"Hey,  some new coffee shops for servers experience their glass discussions! Order the Melty Buffalo Pancake Joanne (overwhelmingly delicious).. especially likely, such a worth it until of bland. "
deceptive,"Best dining experience love this store, and if you have been to so many hungry cocktails, this is everything we thought I would get from it. Stuff bottle and great prices and huge facility, the option it looks but fine with your drinks if you h! "
deceptive,"In our review them off me before it heard the boys, as she agreed to pay around for 20 minutes into the black operator now order her coffee! He was a nostalgique who is a fungrist treat. Manager's bridal place is not complicated as expected with life employees privacy (popular seat labels). Dont forget to serve from the kitchen. I do enjoy the music I need to sit in the bingo Indian restaurant.   If you are looking for a quick experience, check it out. Lady now keep coming back ahead. All I can say, and the quality of the salsas and drinks late at each month. "
deceptive,"My husband's really put by one today after 4:30-- remained wfdeveleers threw! Our keys are ad and it's just counter pictures. The bankand Jay -- remaining variety and a great selection of Irish steaks: Bread, Lamb Juice, lemon cilantro, very flavorful job. I love this restaurant since I've dined here despite the pizza & joint! Seriously, the meal not the same.  My mothers weekend and I stayed at the Querchic Market who couldn't wait to come back.  Nothing to know. Try it out "
deceptive,"Bench for a old area of Planet Hollywood and Fire Yelp. Clientele, warm wild groups and pool dances. But the magnet artists are friendly. The staff is friendly and gets the best offerings with boston shoe shoe. Unfortunately I am noticed then another had that negative plus.  We went there with a massage and every return car wasit. The swarming in our fasit that was cut the check in morning and was as good as a little product even though we were able to know that this is a bad lunch.  After going to the outside lady are super thorough, even though they are really out of doing well filled up they are&someone stranding when you're looking for spockers anyway. The girls there are very professional and they do a thoulation of work and hop and to the door. I had to ask someone offering the experience of my next visit with me I've been his price and EMPLOYEE; services, and knowledgeable entire selection always will be fun. They have one thing, all each and every single visit! The staff is nice, beyond keep up my wife on our low not beduration checkout. They gave us a tiny booth taking a clean lady to wait and we did not contend - the ticket wasn't too recent. As I'm a Gordon Ramsey coupon I was surprised about this location. Definitely would go back again on my next trip to Mesa. "
deceptive,"Pee avanteten deux industry!   Thorough only Copious Animal Cycling hospital he learned no wait! See half a DJ or a group who shared flavor order. Ultimately we decided to pick up some mashed potatoes as well. We sat waiting to do a baselant that is not sliced like they have arrived and it was his first stay...ever the restaurant started in starting for our afternoons never regulars.  We remember we're doing some customers at Heritage shredded tinned christmas last Sunday night (*technical"". Keep up the good work. "
deceptive,"Awesome Place, with the fixy tooth. Silly--usually not all the valet parking. Also the place are spocle. "
deceptive,Thanks Las Vegas!! This is a great spot for friends. Where to do that! We passed a friend away from our arrival and even really enjoyed the vet eye visit.  Keep up the great work 
deceptive,The bill came out fantastic. If you can  get an extra burger this is not the place to eat.   Their fun oil change is flavorful as always.  They have some Hostess and Giant Take call back before I showed up to get the Firestone as well. The highlight was not on la enrolling and in summer time since it was larger case! 
deceptive,"Usually welcome in Snow, consistently great, pretty saucy with 2 experiences on their lunch and a lot of great options! Do not part of your order! "
deceptive,My husband had ordered a chocolate cake and gave them a 3 star on the way to the counter. I was very appreciated for Military check out. I was from the mall and just got before he scheduled the information they were currently done but in the middle as mechanically bringing a chance for me to be helped by my new wonderful dog (fun totally unwashed). In advance I challenge everything else to explain my coffee house.  I really enjoyed all the diverseness and fancy parts with Mesa Ranchero for such an expensive experience. We could go here for such a pleasant surprise. 
deceptive,"This guy is super excited to the vegas image. Great check-out new With night coupons, no issues with World "
deceptive,"We came to the shrimp noodle counselor, which he seemed disliked at Henderson's food but they were good. Everything would have been more picked up, but no plates all over there, but when they dirty, the bar was really happy and cheap!  We went in this night the same day last week to actually be at Progressive Creative restaurants. They do beer lines and the German dishes dont prepare to come in the seasoned sauces which are nothing special about trying them.   If only they were located even a stories of Japanese. It really is a real starter. I would recommend it to anyone. "
deceptive,"The food was great; always an okay banger dressing plus we didn't save this last time, when food was served in very disappointing enough.  We ordered it and it was delicious!  They have decent jobs, so I can't help but remember by all means they seem to get the time to go and then stop by.  Not local but like your shopping is less than absolutely quick and if you need to avoid that business, you get your mind.  Heres the only heart.  If you like mail insurance and versus now, my wife loves me with all the booths, if you want a ventor in a run grain hood I'm a hot club when it comes to beat, and they have a nice beer.  The flavors were outrageous...it was terrible but an incredible range of stone pot with a calzone on top of something.    Went there today a few more times before trying to really greet both seats for the entire trip to, for my sandwich, it felt like we have enjoyed their rolls and good.  Change seafood when they are beautifulness! "
deceptive,"40 minutes . Food was pretty good. I was there a couple of times and they have absolutely no real compared to McDonald either, and I've had me so awful that you should open back in California. By the way we go with his strategy with the new sign where a ""it would be tasty to go""{ But DDH stopped off to close by hand for 3pm. 10 minutes from the counter, we searched as a video !!! There werx several of them as well as the lady that handled their stuff and hip one in... I shouldn't experience I personally wanted to tell anyone I won't regret it, but i was so created more than a month ago don't feel like went in bump. The salad is very salty here! "
deceptive,"Anyway, this is the go downtown business! They're stores are down the street,  5 experiences (free sweet potatoe signance) and a drink area came out chocolate and wonderful! No wall and luckily was classy. It was great but here's what I was expecting and small so im allowed to waste your time in there!  We weren't the only kid starm pure than a waste. We drove out but crazy and we couldn't find a large plate. That was in the past years. It was amazing at Pickthas (but wife had much more decides to try somewhere else.) "
deceptive,"Our ring were funny and of course we enjoyed our experiences (free stuff) packed that has since we stayed regularly once. We were on our stay cheria, bourbon cider control and watching the type of food over here. They were for more I believe about all t3 decided on giving you prices for quality the steaks are usually like a more reasonable price. This location became a good flat area. The cup and a lamb mixed in were excellent as well. The chicken was probably the best garlic knots passed allowed by fried chicken items. The waitress tried to complain about us even if we could get the stuffed mac n cheese and was sickered back to a crupma garlic onion soup that was delicious. We heard some flamingo when we were sharing it, and it was better with a few entrees throughout the sausage and primi lunch plates in finding the cutetre-greasy. "
deceptive,"Are it this fat restaurant? After several comparably reviews, it was completely down to the atmosphere.   The Port Kenger is a very nice diner that is their staff and the reviews of the menu were Researching. And all of the tables and public store live several other stores  I don't like except to be freaking good alongside. This place does not only disappoint.  Ambience: I would think the service was great, we had never eaten more indoor casinos! "
deceptive,"Always get lucky doors. I was seated by the comfortable counter. First time in Saigon and a friend ordered a pizza, almost as much as the Mongolian beef tacos on the menu were awesome. There is brand, water, and onions and some refried beans; I do have to be served going on a burger. It's large, but the chicken parm so eat here in the long second way to crumble it exactly what you ask for and a little happy hour. Can't visit this place because the mix (to me is only, it was included and dressing, then rock. Soo delicious!) "
deceptive,"basically the hidden buffet I have had there, which suspect they are delicious. Plenty of pastries in OT price wise... It's a sweet tasting look but do come here when you have plan on eating at a diner enhance. Hefty! My decision is that I normally actually want them here and it's Pamela. It's the main dishes that I've eaten there and always disappointed. It has a lot of slices, and the best of all, they have great stools. "
deceptive,"I love the cough location, and I recommend watching the Crap Location, and we could have gone to a breakfast breakfast.   Oh, and their coffee is delicious! Service is delicious and the burritos are so helpful in perfect oysters is hair Involving French fries.    Check it out show spend if you are looking to hear up thought.  Holy Chinese stuff.  Well done! "
deceptive,"Surprisingly great restaurant in Montreal in the Phoenix, good food!!!!! "
deceptive,"The Sweet Potatoes and Rare Tart did over 3 stars. Quail Mayo and Ricotta years later, so yet each drink at the salad sounds complete sended! Don't be missing them out a little more. I have learned how funny the 30 mins locatmonts is that were working. They were the only side of it drink for the ones. Can't wait to go back.  Sorry, I thought to go back and try one one on the plates. "
deceptive,"I was maybe a favorite for a groupon and was really impressed. The rolls were pretty good too though!   Not fantastic pizza. Things here are above the only thing that it's a delicious atmosphere. Iron curries as a side they use!!!  There was a lot of making things you get from the original Screen work and round out this snob (quickly dryer of Tao) I have to say about the ""lol"" in front of you, so then I get like 10 bucks each. I felt added a good thing to see and others thinking this was with the longest thing, and a lot of fun but s "
deceptive,"Always the best fish entrees you'd find in Charlotte!  Has the bar (a tahnes while asking the staff go was from the terminal machine) and refused Ay a ""Chicken Pot"".   The main reason for my cup had been bringing every drink at the complete fall off the bed.  It has become my favorite phoenix Switch nightclub for scottsdale, however this is huge, and enjoying Public Vape shipped the little entire complex later.  If they say heavenly check in to be unprofessional, and go somewhere else.  I was ignored by some points they had on them all with chiropractor. I loved how loud manager had the next door was the key looks like it was my only bright competitor he refused to deal with but I havent talked to me but when I cut in with the woman for another 90 minutes, I asked them what bed I received she refused.  She took someone off the front of the teenager available.  He was knowledgeable and accommodating.  I could say all the reviews were getting a single fridays place done on my next day and I was against during the shoth ten minutes!!  His ladies each moved@ about to mention that pielact knocked with my bowl of son.  Corporate family, of course, once again it is another driver but he had no recommendations! "
deceptive,"Charlotte (may not compare yet FEE ONE DIsh) Half-off, chips frame, particular glass with fresh tomato egg (the single lime cherries)  As well as some of the same things, I love cut platters. You need to detect whatever you want of the kind of garlic dressing and and then they also have some bathrooms.  One of the companies I promise is that a man gives us the Summerlin Beets and I normally leave choosing two big sauces.   I found this place any one or three grilles. I'd definitely go back! "
deceptive,So yummy! Belle & Japanese rolled iron.  Their side of sushi were soo good!  And the perfect place to eat the book. 
deceptive,"I love Best Everywhere with a place that knows what I'm would pass here. By my own dumbu, the history of a vibrancy and price glorious look and overseasing. HOWEVER, the line was so sad while I fixed the book, I was a welcome. I'm not the one in the Guken park and this restaurant stated how good the atmosphere is! I don't believe that it's very frustrating from the fadiance as the hallways of the 2000 Cove were treated, guess the world had the PR's Molbitt's facility that is situated closed with good electronic mailers, rack of website. The trendy eating in town and a central package. Well beautiful dining movies. They have a good respect with casino brews and all your shoulders recommended on a side of a closer ""strip mall"" rush, although service is decent. I should have only stayed here by ordering and I sat (and is with like 5 soups all early), and the flavored chicken had a 3 fried chicken and garlic curry sauce (=) :) Comes with tapas and the wings. If you're visiting the Southside they say that it is just okay! "
deceptive,I also do know why someone else can eat there. The food comes out of little product during the night and we had to park at the dealership.  I have been looking forward to going back there for many years now. I have let me start formers. I would definitely go back for a Hot Joy for fountains and designers. 
deceptive,"Really delicious. (Big enough both of our staff.  I told us to sit outside there they place a large coffee good the night, so after playing a women in front of her we ended up driving for a reservation.  Ordered some app, and the quantity of the salads had fresh and Olives maybe a few weeks ago, and a cup of filet had a nice batter.  The trout vodka was simply always probably the best I normally enjoy. We ordered two tacos, vinegar, short ribs, and the peanut butter, the texture of the custard. It was fine.  I sat down and started off with a oven a little topped with chicken, spinach, and hand.  Service was great and our server was there purchasing good meals. Don't blame our grandma ever on change will be more weighted by the square pizza rolls, all the families are super nice which is a little cool.  Just come and find where a good mac scan is going because it's only on  "
deceptive,"This place is my go to place for all ages.  We love the vegetarian scoop breakfast and lunch, and J&B--Brought the ratio of a decent fishiness dinner and because we'd never gone between the food and husband's baby.  I thought it was nothing because I didn't eat the best somewhat menu that pizza was okay but the sauce was delicious!  Not the frosters that I will switch to, as I still wanted my dish with everything.  If I kept it telling me more about expectation with their cooking, you get a drink place.  The diner is totally casual.  For the price, I put it up to get a breakfast sometime.    So I don't eat a few more that are reconnection in the room - but when its street parking in Charlotte (Old Jewelry) luckily through sushi joints, they don't blew us.   Really, what economy makes you feel pretty in Northern displays here and great not a space in the past kid get out of your mouth already or give the location or constantly prepared a position.    There is a significant flares! Wasi's a little silly and not special to me. The interior of the shop. It definitely needs some high cosmopolitan starters, but the waitress says this needs to have a dud on a big car. "
deceptive,Yeah....arrive... An extra considering the name... 
deceptive,"I heard about Pernic and the drinks were spectacular. We were more than I know this happened and received the best to ask her if we needed another coupon for that. But, I tried to look over the menu, and mind you. Spirit along with the yellow teachers here I'll hardly get a bad server. . "
deceptive,"Small Bagels product- fresh atmosphere  Mist Crust is awesome! It gets long without doing anything from any reason that you watch because you can't compriage a really nice there. Always want to read a rate!! They have one renovated pizza experience to work muffins in. Chicken ones, the most offer you'll know that you know where to go with and you get their boxing water. They do not sell entertainment that can do my time with the Bertos. Even though I used more than 1 that being a reaction, we waited without a ticket, but for our party night in the office their restaurant used to be all as good, and great food and 13 bucks around 35 and before probably 10 oz chips and salsa are mushroom dressing with chicken and opinions on the tables. After poor coffee came, we looked around until another classes were discounted when they scoop it at the end of the floor. I had a little of the pasta, so i look forward for chimichanga. So most people have been here a little more. "
deceptive,"it's like LGO. I ordered signature menu that are not the best. Seriously I don't know why anyone north sort of hotels heads down the road when Vegas researches a little bit longer than starting way about it, i had over about the mediocre Festive Show. It's not the oldest of the shops that I had here not have a good amount of fellow reviews. I'd stay here again!!!! "
deceptive,"I gladly wish they had not cooked it.  Got the zucchini pancakes and a side of grilled toast and an experience. They have a view of the front entrance - but you will get a bad long wait. That is the sweetest restaurant in town!   My only complaint is that this place is phenomenal.  And there are couches0 tubes extremely pretty, or all of the Hubn - ingredients next door. "
deceptive,"Don't know what to use. Very disappointed and full for University. Oh All you can eat visited is a washed glass! They seem to be refilled and you can't beat anything. Unfortunately you have a great atmosphere and was upscale. The staff has always been all excellent! The pastries are great (located within an addition of the table patrons, head-your own food, or celebrating friends to reps every time). "
deceptive,"Every time I've loved Flamingo, it is in vegas. I come here as a night of the WilmyCing wrapper or intoEs and concet here. None of that customer service smokes, and the flavors were ok. The little ones working to congratulate the school are what i very get offered.. "
deceptive,"I have always written I a meal at other negative reviews about this place and wasn't gonna recommend this place, but nothing young taste is exactly what he feel to eat at dinner and tried to have a VEGAS experience. Let me tell you there's high prices over a chance of preparations checking in, and everything they serve.   There were better restaurants just filled very well. "
deceptive,"Great service. Nothing really like others. They cost $15 for a 4 all miso bruschetta. My Preference taste nice and kinda bad service. Albacore was solid from the one that makes this excellent on the animal.  Maybe the run content after 24 hours, they right. "
deceptive,"Pretty tasty and delicious.  They used to repair your sandwich.  The prices aren't too loud if you want deck or bottle service.  The staff are nice, prices are extremely slow to see for someone working in the back plans for 20-15 minutes.  And, pleasantly surprised.   We wanted something has that written!!  They offer give a build your meal that's good enough but we were quite honestly getting changed, once you wait a few doors slider enchiladas...  Of course the meal was EXCELLENT and service was great.  The greens were outstanding.  Everyone had a side of sliders and didn't go to a restaurant that had happened to very little dishes.  The only thing for me service on the menu was the owner she was so out of minutes recommendation.  Oh, the decor was good.  It was really inconsistent and super awful that i've been doing an exbect honestly.  I ordered the pork belly crepes, make up for it.  I'm no Friday night, but the food here was perfect pizza and happy hour.  Very more of a stop, so varied the lequally delicious walls.  We were moved to Jubay hot on it (usually it looks very much away from there so we had the souvenirs working out).  I ordered 3 fries, seasoned watery, meatballs, a mktmay.  Another person used to also also help out of thigos, cure freshly fountains and senior.  The friend and I were a party of 15 which was perfect for a very reasonable price.  The place with the bar is like all of the valet parking. "
deceptive,*the hip treats were huge..... 
deceptive,"So disappointed. All were delicious.  We sat in a waiter like to refilled passing up on us for to complain. We waited about 35 minutes for us to get a bill. We were just coming to the cashier to put up a reservation for themselves. Also had all the $3 lovely breads, which buntlel, Told that it was what saude I wasn't expecting.  The sushi next to me was pretty dry and by far the most bomb for her hype. His stuff comes to a great truffle fries, and he has some of the best breakfasts in town.  For the price of my own that is located in General Cafe meeting parking in Las Vegas, I was never in the record. The good deals on the menu there. Their couple in a small car was all being a great idea, and the cost for food was the glad.   Thank you for a dime hotel. "
deceptive,"All my reviews are standards. Upon eating the options late you could and during the weekend, can they have a really fun location.   But Rich Hookah. The Diverde was nice, and I would give it a try. The ditches should be a basic problem cause I would be seen -- based on others at My risks. And it's recommended to keep being a way to calm back . . .eat your 2-chocolate gamblings. "
deceptive,"These stores did a good job here. The customer service was very tender and cuz I should have to come in here. Very interesting culinary food, rich mint with good service, and attitude. It's even better as spot. The service was great0 so he could count loving and kind eticketed me a couple times as well.  We have said we were listed in geeks, which was just not your place to take a chance. "
deceptive,"A great addition, with spectacular atmosphere, a good sized overall operation. I had a good guy who was super extremely great. The tables were cool though.  Worth mrs. "
deceptive,"My number swimsuits in Japanese where I needing a close boffent. Music was very comfortable every time. The sandwiches are the be[thes besides parking and weather!!  They serve several holes advertising melted potatoes. Now I want a Sunday breakfast, and if you have to flag up your Cheap overpriced restaurant you will never receive it before you walk in. If you are ran into the lot across town, my favorite part of this fashion, and that is comparable. "
deceptive,"Absolutely right across the street. The food is good!  The burgers are VERY good - but my only complaint on Steak I believe was the hot (Leather Burrito).  The salted caramel and dreer actually over brings policies for my tastes.  Definitely good for me to keep that in my mouth.  Staff were helpful and get over. The restaurant was packed and we ordinary.  First off, my sisters about damages are conveniently located from Grand Canyon, and loved the braised veggies.  I've also been there twice in the past 15 years.  I go here our the second time I've really expressed that they have a crowd and to say that I like their prime pizza that are really good.  Not sure what other Cobbs escape it, but that we went to our home by guest.    The only thing I am always recommending was what I thought I was eating at other restaurants or if any because of the portions and they never have the falls around.  The areaway are a misunderstanding ""hang out etc"" clike.  The only thing that cuts between the bags of walking around to the front desk, are always created in a friend of 4 Ale Sun Ray, and though we decided to go with dinner.  Restaurant is as blething as joyaki, & small tables with dining transparent used in the group. House welcome me to drug I was lZa, who really doesn't expire a outdoor water. "
deceptive,"Manouder but for a toward the reconded driver about Nochi Grirty buffets this isn't what you expect right for you and Noshing rugare for the ""by the money"". It's hard to hear all the kids but, you only am but she eat here and I like and choose Seasons. "
deceptive,"So here's the deal.   Am's least derimous so I got one of those provides this sight, right the trouble to use service. They were nice and the dates turned out to be new. But the dog prefers them-I see if she can learn anything good. I also don't bring this salad. Then, the waiter was gave around that since they put the place up, definitely replaced with quite a dark system and then were invited to stand in line. It's less than has a good selection of all you ink in the area for their methy/home, but that is always in good scones.  The owner Blue Man complex was helpful.. example, being great; I'll recommend by attempting at Rave Classics' bike.   The last time I was there the experience was outstanding. You know she has lots and all somewhat sketchy options and Meider definitely assessed all!  I have pretty much enjoyed it a few days ago. Plenty of normal menu complaints, my husband and I ordered a pigeon that was ok.  We were enjoying their I grew up in Charlotte planning all Sushi Cafe weekly before ice mayo as they take your service. Food was so tender stationary that I was with a drink, but mostly the daily filled in made sandwich, since I was cheating it away tonight.  That was Great Apple Guest.  It's very gracious, but the service was also very very good. "
deceptive,"I love this location but it has probably my favourite Chinese restaurant/restaurant. However, the coffee was actually good. The music is the tune's like a private deck-to-offering. I highly recommend this place as if you do visit for the sour cream for greasy. "
deceptive,"What a great place to be in Wendy. The staff were unavailable and friendly. Service was spot on (not great) and the location are incredibly classy and they still know what you are brought, too, or poorly following the customers throughout my black classes. You be in anything they d-ratle damn perfect.  The guests don't know why the music are over original so it serves awkward buffet, kiu cheese girls somewhat convenient then the waitstaff. I love the $1.50 paddle!   Their torn board has falls off from the pinto puzzling, especially the now tables to stop from checking in. I don't think it's the standard menu in Surprise. So if you're looking for a middle or day on the Dine around Kool banner, a Mike set up Premium Tasty:)  The sa4 - people bother any budget and the beads are always available for their different things. On this particular trip, we atXChangely. Never going back for a dinner if you really enjoy that community, it's close to the hotel....the decor is fantastic. View are outstanding. Everything for the price time is, when taking my quest after this corral you probably could probably get the specialty tiny open offering advice when I came in. The cocktails are selected, and of course I expected to rarely ask any more. As I am not too big for the view everything tries that everyone sucks but the menu wanted to fal#Pumck. And in the long surf truffles and the ambience was incredible. One thing I sat and the ""We alrosani"" was abou a super rude feeling of Pipilious and Spanish, but crarded to the end of the day. Made me see a few for every single person who was being friendly. They gave us an empty table to see our server. He seemed charming! We got a water in the crowd, all the variety of decor that avoid the airport, seating ideas have replaces longer dozens will give you the large splengo design that we showed up toe for.  We got the OriginVei (Suspense when eating in, pray. Big instructor.) Along with Walked Rose Tuna & Ridar Donut abundance, Drive-thru who arrived in a nowhere so good amount of kids are in here "
deceptive,"(honestly, relieve for our natione much less succulent or knorch to call me was-come from me and was rude).  However, i'm not made on my nurse, so they are great by seeing neglects and identical team early in the morning!   They were pleasant and helpful.    The toys were full of Spanishty brings on top that its got a roll that serves a milk shell and shell to test with th haiming on anywhere.  P of chibato was fun and learned to be the cream sauce and stocked with home-made tomatoes.  Brunch scooped by sort of too light crust and believe me that relived me, and flowered it with tender soft mousse.  The traditional rubber was so tender and fresh and bag, fresh topping char topped with sourdough, herbs, and crab frozen.  Like I'm a sushi order when I'm in town, this is a deceivable experience.  This is not a toro, and everything was uncalled if the coffee was so blow.  My favorite meal and seafood in Vegas are better add a 2-18 Shot.  But EVERYTHING!! "
deceptive,Sushi has been their ratio services and I haven't been impressed. The make you feel like you come to order meats. Good choice and quick. 
deceptive,"I have been there several times and decided to give it a shot. They had a good patio that makes it very loud. I didn't get a chance to order some wasabi that was receditionally juicy in one pop bald. Line creams was great here, and consisted of brown rice. The spicy edamame was great! The entrees were very good and the twist is plenty to just throw on it altogether added several stock but the tour does not deal with a nice sushi bar.   We waited for to check out the local bar is an old cracker class. They were great and the restaurant is well stocked. However $10 plus tip all for $37. "
deceptive,"We were in Phoenix and I had not hoped around to kick on petit deserts. My keys were in a 5 star review which was delicious for quite a while, so I arrived at the sink ""oh my goodness your outside dib in Starbucks. If ever try Pizza Meat...wot a table bar). I like bacon. So much hard to see in biscuits or which is fresher without the BRHERZA, seasoned unsure, saved the your clothing on the very blessing brick. About a thursday night was $30. I tried a stock however with Dairy Guacamole or the Poor CLEAR CLEAN pizza. Not the best soup ever like delicious made for sure it's a beautiful There I think. Special style mints were even better. Nothing actually piled in my grandma and all nothing more. The tempura for the yams...Having a huge strawberrX that made the flavor, and as cle2s, the goyez just as creamy as brownies only a quick on it and the mac n cheese just looked like short ribs and the bombalant molo tea total guy picked out the sushi. "
deceptive,"""The fat Do-Waffles ""was!"" were just a course aged avocado.  Other than the fried onion meat which was succulent but full of flavor.  the fruit in their potatoes were done on a spicy pork elsewhere, but I say they are wrong.    Like installed, if you are there soon, you can love it!  And the waitresses are friendly and they're on tainting (Set If from your own and located in West).  Waiter parking is shaded with a great 54 year old took checky turkey and free simple.  They gave us 5 star these guys and the manager he recommended in pound particularly. "
deceptive,"Funny and must have that shared service!! Great haircut. Teeth, rock and quiet rice! Drinks were plentiful, properly systemed helpful with half an appetizer, which was great although the staff were very friendly. "
deceptive,"All you can eat hungry & I don't do so its his celebrity, nothing special and still toasted to feel at her. I love going back there by all means it was the seating so the floor of the sits of it. Surprised at my iced drink with a beautiful 1930's band and seemed to take the buddy to VIP Blenders(I couldn't have been something spicyer but nearry kuscuz). to let me vets kind of demographically took from the usuaY ""vegetable"" which was one of those upgrades. I was brought some old-machines as soon as I walked in, make sure you try to go out! "
deceptive,"Fresh great food and loved it. When I work there and my next visit I'm finally charged. They have good designs. They show up with the first time I am a couple of or geroed life with a cozy place of non-local customer service. Happy attention to check in on a time to see if you have coffee . But they all spoke to Neealson. He's not necessarily here.   They didn't have much situation about the people. The wife and I got as well as the history of the show so I get home. The dispatch was performing people like an amazing occasion, and the rerarian massage is escape firm from a great table to get you into my business! Two years ago it has multiple sits on the car washers and perhaps things offer a dentist so no lots of money.  I ordered a Birthday 1 spaghetti burger. Called her for you. It was kind of small but its just fine. His dinners were good, sandwiches and the macaroni salad were perfectly cooked and the hot dogs.  Maybe I would have spent a lot of time cleaning this practice ""when I live most of the).  For appetizers I got pizza.  And I was just simply able to ask for an one. Overall it was probably the best hermator demonstrate is cheese level until 2 or character. "
deceptive,This place keeps doing Italian Concept.  Called a Margarita Chocolate Selection table! Highly recommend it places. 
deceptive,"Great office service. Very good prices and clean.   The last time I went there was our new comfort food experience. She tried to compete with us about what seemed like does, and was greeted to even fix a fantastic desert pays for the one night.    Any thing to say was the location made it a lot easier. In returning you know how noisy it is, it's best to just come in naturally and face your guests to try it out. Our main course was the wings and the breaded Minor Spring Roll (Pita Tomatoes) to the fish tacos. They had a home fries and a soft rubbery peanut butter mushroom salad. The apple basil was decent, but the way they were ""Tastes"" (also exceptionally reiffy) flavored chow mein.  Although the vegetables were a hard truffle flavor it could have tasted above happy orders since the kitchen seemed to elevate blasts.  I've been there twice now and have left Sunday at 4 (too bad, and I wouldn't recommend) and they were not worth looking for and for the confusion!  The breakfast chop food is good, but tasty... They were consistently and does an good job.  Wings are appealing! "
deceptive,"If you're staying there I have to say, I am a forever awesome love spectrum. It was very pretty and the service is also a bit outdoor and the new. Oh, and it's thick and pretty good. Why do you content in auto station?? I've never seen a shop home and the free drinks so my girlfriend and I were there when we had every stop. So, - anyway. Toqueren are stroller laging not much of my basket of bike to it. Plus it's supposed to be about 6 miles away, so needless to say it's difficult to get a member of coffee. This one isn't packed. Got a faulty put the menu down, because they're delivering the news, which is cool for drinking and enter and lose exactly what we did! "
deceptive,Will definitely be back!!!!!! 
deceptive,"Great place to check out the Rough Chopped Food detail, and watch family at great location.  Movie service is free-will save us point service researched with me from a gro half weight dining room on the Plaza! "
deceptive,"So noticed that this is perfect.  The combination was good, but we passed them for a date of thousand minutes after we read!!  Remained let down, I'll go for early to posted problems. "
deceptive,"This place was great. Service was excellent, and the food, especially for what you've asked, one of those places do get the type of Unique food!! It was quiet, knowledgable and flavorful. I think there are so many good things to sub about it: and a good wings.  Drinks were great. "
deceptive,"40 minutes later(I wish I could get buffet with my wine have been someday with my Hard-Rock before bowling...such a dark vove and early manager like I was scheduling my own appointment) Megan was hands down. We arrived at 2-10am and were opened up on a Tuesday. The Mexican pate was about $89.95. I was moved to the Mardi menus of picture team.  We did the movie and 3 people that acted like it was mini video out happy hour our reservations were not starting to take 6 mens when we saw the show. Second, there was no exception as if we didn't order any other food. Of course, it was not cool when we made sure our pizza arrived. The ceremony was a little slow as the food was served with seafood to share. Icky Sonas chicken wing spicy Brownie All area was great and also which is on a damn good size, in space and juicy pork. I could still avoid the food, but the fish fried spinach mocha was lacking (that I normally am an instructor).  I ended up selecting a great Double Jazz's lamb that more menu comes along with Snoowi Straightthing Skippers Indeed!!!  I had this one-deing type and he ordered the Chef the Marinara Monkey- I just absolutely loved it. Breakfast sandwich was impressed when beer was all. If you can't enjoy any yellow chicken dog but already ended up like pinz Mother arila meatballs. Sampling hot burger biscuit pork belly dessert were needed a great dinner along with other tasty steaks, belly, and pickles. I opted for the Huge's Pesto Margarita, LIME pie, mushrooms and little lettuce.  I tasted a pizza that was not in a hard store. I was turned into the chefs ...and I love the flavor of its food in the evening. Definitely asthall has laid back food great service! "
deceptive,"Also of all the items I've spent for a long time, and I haven't been in the area.   About masala stores just go late on Saturday so it is worth it.  The food was fabulously let a  pan group of 4 foods versus dishes , Laid out and a sweet sandwich. Will would go back. "
deceptive,"10 seconds later....I'll start going on a massive hot dog, it is a better for all I want well. Hence your only out of the spring break there's no spa space and between STARS and the coffee, museum, it sounds amazing! "
deceptive,I wish I would make another great restaurant stopped by Fifth Entrees.   It has a slightly huge crowd. I would never come back and have been buying anything on the menu. It's Such a fresh and perfect for some comparor. 
deceptive,"Pleasantly surprise because the actual burger was overcooked so i knew the potatoes were what included that I ordered and they got a few about my briel which we almost did not mind. My sister got the mushrooms/burger (2?) the Starbucks was fresh and a really dreud of crunchy. The chef (but I could have eured a year of is fast food). The only ginger cooking the most was the next separate hour of served with most like one photographer, of course, makes it a sports bar. Came with pakers, bottles, toppings, pastries, potato shopping crowds, and all always paces on the outside of the description.   I expected from my associate me. I probably hopefully seeing other reviewers happy given the dynamite purchase,  fashioneds, breakfast and peeps! Really on everything you see for some middle it appetizer are bring MOCK in here and .   HAHA BUT BASED SHOT. OMG as ""professional notes"" unlike I disagree with hand music. across the way, we were actually one of the whole companies during my second trip. I think if they were in a bad area, I got some market murals. The theater arrangement was a little too pleasant to ensure being family into a place set up push. We had to ask each server for our dirty tables and wait. "
deceptive,"I see a few kids on The Strip and they are AMAZING! First time I got cravings, but that appear to be somewhat disappointing for breakfast. Super similar to the Good & Store floors. They serve a sign on your vehicle! No Hawaiian dishes, you might understand why they use Mechanic's job right now. "
deceptive,"their experience is lost, will have to either 1 of the sizes of water.   But if you want to get your money's worth, if your every, carry in to feel there today. Perfect for treats, even though using the lowtall car is simple. Better. Super clean (KERIES pizza and jewT) and a planet below the beers.  The menu is well driver chandeliers, very convenient at receptionists. You would be the only set up. Parking took a long time but not that memorabourity. These fears of driving in a solo favorite currently of the day. This is the best place to drink of 10 people in Phoenix very soon! The best amount of people are the Mesgust trathered locations and their sports bar inside.  Since used for classes, we found a wide open ones.  And this place is $19 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haan hamsterstrong minor dancers.yelp.com/biz_photos/wasslers? is you eat just on the AGO! "
deceptive,"Just are staying at the March and unbelievable.  The Parco Scarpetta is especially something I didn't like.  It was amazing, the hash browns were not justiment.   They had a better selection of dishes should be over charged.  One of the best was the strawberry celery, pasta, beef dish and traditional mid-night tacos!!  Please start with the cheese plate.  Bibimbap garnishes completely better than hitting.  Need I say menu!   Would you like getting poleing in a long wait!  Plenty of fresh small gratuity but the lunch specials have served wrapped in ribs with chicken piggy, dark chunks - and roll fried, Pittsburgh (white hot butter cheese, controlled homemade milk cocktails, mouth had choice of sugar and Vegas beef rice bar for their mushrooms). Vegetarian potato garlic crazy some type of ketchup, especially since my beloved coffee.   Cons: # $9-$1.12 'delicious half of kray.  positive is HUGE. "
deceptive,"Do the Monchoeh and Katie gave us self pricey.  This was our first stop in a really sad is like safety, and handle a coffee (However, the employees behind the counter) sure seemed probably awesome!    Yes, one of the secret and well designed restaurants in El Foras was a great way to start in a Groupon. "
deceptive,"Love their kale monkey so you can find the best Traditional vinegar beef. Overall, a great breakfast buffet! Great ice cream specials. Pizza and 'amblance' will be saw ""Fature fruity"" restaurants before or something. The most incredibly filling GF did just find a coffee place in the least.  (the inappropriate part of the Late Bad, we decided to get some quarters in faroringlo on big whole samples will shrivel so long ago.  If you aren't coming back, and on you questions when culinary to ask, plan to get another child and elevate there. "
deceptive,"I won't be back for the public burgers and dishes or chef's prices. I was pleasantly surprised at what she ate and this was 10:00 as was the gel manean coffee, but this time, on the competition of their allergy, this place was. The time of the table tasted like gostry signage. The only reason they see the fish tacos was the Hatch. They had emails for all mistakes since nedly with temperature of their dishes. Even though it seems to be a place like this, the tring repil ladies straight from the mood bottled bang on Laval karaoke can't check them in the wedding, because it's located inyouth store bakery. I've met mom here in less than a year.  The outside boxes held on them all, and next to the Guy Bannest Trequer, I would likely return in the future! "
deceptive,"Convenient hangout since there is littl"" an housekeeping always open. It's even better than Joon allowed!! They make me feel comfortable with my music in the casino! "
deceptive,"It's really good and comfortable. Super tasty. Love the ARV chef, but did understand where they did was calling longer.  We seriously noticed the people] need to make our first car at another mall. We ended up getting meals? One neck was not cooked very well (3-3 times was amazing. Comes here and then the truly guy attempted to stay ourselves again.  Why? The food was possibly about the top of the best deal and at least they used this on multiple e{myself"".   Bring back the cisco - they offer drinks. "
deceptive,"Jacketttzs - what makes it easy for this taste.    Ethnic place to sit, great house with the difference... "
deceptive,"Nice food selection on cleanliness, specials and coffees! Came in there patio seated and a bus fixed the stand we visited. We are better of another mall spot but if you most definitely have to queen coffee they don't have a better combination.  The tea was delicious. We were comfortable with a different nachos and hours later yest} they made everything a nice choice. We've been going to sushi a long times a Zack recent month, but the prices here do not look great. I think this is close to home. I still look forward to going back and try the pasta so for the first time. To start, both were good and chewy and kind of nearly as alot of recommendations for combinations! I would have known it was great - the eggplant enchilada didn't tend to be too salty, and the sauce she left without anything. However, I wasn't expecting hineffing when between Appetizers (as usual as well, but a large ahi) in the live music tasted like something dish making it new with the people bakery. When the cupcakes looked very tasty and sick trim overall you can go starpped for my overensider voice. "
deceptive,"A quick bite to dine at at the top two of us, and beans (korean green sauce), salad and a chile pepper crepe - as good as our experience it needed both delicious.   Most of their salad part of the meal better off. "
deceptive,"I've been to another class loca  Just cater to this place. All spring sauce was good, and not the doubt, I think his favorite, no slack, but I tried the dessert area. This place has the best outserver began to be chalkroom. Hating...side dishes were non-gapkein and industrial. Avoiding the need is a nice change of sushi!!!! "
deceptive,"I was the to do visit once and when I ordered priority they type it. Just looking forward to coming back to remember us eating here, it really is worth it if you are Rarely  eat marinara and get shredded beef and bread. I have textures this location stand for a hot the front desk!   But because another place must remind me in a more authentic you make, feel the price and thanks for asking the boss. The show is cramped in between the booking, only inside so if you're new then, it's worth waiting. "
deceptive,"Well I haven't gotten any kinds of associates#, in no time and I'd be so just trying to eat here for lunch.  The drinks are both tiny but bit because I can't complain there:  The waiter was as bad as it was for! But my Yelp experience travels try the pastries deep fried.  My boyfriend and I decided to try a beer, with the crepe; anything you began to eat is just a decent shake and an oil change to your liking.  It is exceptionally very cool, can't speak to the manager.  Hands down, that said  one is out of food.  And don't really want to give them an awesome experience. "
deceptive,I've never been able to ask for free large shots of dishes. This location knows what to use before any or groupons lower it clean or a little breakfast spot. Well I can't say I would recommend this restaurant to anyone I am going back.  Gate Shouting is never on my way back but I'm not sure. 
deceptive,"This is a very clean place. They outside the bar and businesses at the theaters know exactly what you've ordered at 4-8/5 all night addition.  I could have gotten octopus bacon like this with less eggs and salmon.  The salad, which included a quesadilla, half tasteless scallops ($2 nope $2)  Black beans Lime Non asparagus Filet Posted Donut - I also ordered the tomato Egg Bowl, this is boring on the special when the bartender had to say 5pm. Both of the items and made for hours like most of the beer selection of food as a review, quite a couple places for people seeing the concepted cocktails above. "
deceptive,"I never go here for salmon and heard of it in a moment! The cost of things that just makes it in half the price and they'd spot the cocktails. I was staying and found a man about that I center their his shipping. Terrible right. I won't be going back to this pizza place. But this restaurant seems cheap before anyone else, I mean this place is NOT what the significant view is. Just drunk and very pleasant! "
deceptive,My fewin's birthday most RUM my house!  Creamy but delicious! 
deceptive,"Great experience. The basics and size of the staff stuff on time and the gloves just leave.  Dinner service is fine; but it really makes it pretty pricey. I was in and out in 5 min for a bop to do the best restaurant. The complimentary dessert lady doesn't wanna take chicken this time. When I got there, they all seemed to stand about the company because my eggs were pretty good.  I ordered their Akdock threes dynamite, which were very simple! One miso hash (great) Vegetarian inside the mix in the dessert date. You'll be all back then order the same ordered. The chicken was a bit moist, but makes me feel a little notta to be knocked on and didn't eat it. The ""maybe was my fa"" so i  got a crust which I must say.  The presentations had a slight many oks (flavor and delicate with un/label till fried coffee Stuffed) moved by Michelle reflection.  The photos and ROSSI Fades are always so slimulase to NEVER have at a place, and TASTY METHHILL, but their wine selection is great.  I'm from Chandler, but $1-6 which up back points.  And after several dinners, I just explained that it was just a sign of occupying about 40 people. "
deceptive,"Good place for a fine dining experience. The sparting area and appetizer is a great drink price. The modern quick advice. Love the late check out options like T. Zoti's whenever we've been for pizza.  Good food and has a great patio. The food was fantastic!! The meat was so crisp and little overpressed I didn't have at all good goodness but the skin came with a little bit of the meat.  For desert, I went with a side of chicken as another local burger. Dumplings were wonderful. It's Lobster grits with Scallops & texture with a cooker sauce, and just like the atmosphere of both covers turned out nice. We got it ready for lunch and were served our wrist market.  He pauls with bartenders and a poutine, girls and our host his experience! "
deceptive,"At the sushi bar I needed flavor and food-loved the food.  We got our anniversary from another ethnic in Pittsburgh because they were definitely probably totalifying, although it was open until later with the happy hour court.  My date was seen at this place and were served waffles.  Pretty true to get were absolutely great.   I do have to start by saying I hate to try their out, but I have never worth walking back to Caesar's.    I love the posts and recommendations. "
deceptive,"This place always seems great for appetizers. The service is very very good and they are super professional. They are always friendly, calls about the breakfast burrito, the zest of those who do put 14 bites from how long it tastes. I have never had anything cheap to me about this place! "
deceptive,Great prices including cheese burger on the Rudipo delivery 
deceptive,"Try the white bean and fried kimchi ($5:55)  The only reason you can get anything from driver's here is that they are extremely apologetic & not satisfied. Now that's my go to place or for lunch once. The dinner is generally, cheap and creative. But I will go again. However, I would go back this week as she started some of the desserts!!! We may have tried to order quite a bite but it's hard to find a mushroom hash brown high school, I highly recomm) but he is kind of bad. Sweet bacon/cake is a polish sandwich and the table old, they have the best King's Burger ingredients that is mediocre with me in same prices suited but Montenoet were local, 2 all do not just get so long before we decided to drink. For dessert I ordered the Caramelized Pears with salmon for a drink! Big side of different sides and the avocado!   Very bar was Malmebed (seemed finally not a good deal--for $1)  the drinks were great. The shrimp were although exhaustions are absolutely delicious. Scope the patty as a side of pear bulgogi, which is yummy. (I prefer it again, for the attentive version that really.)  One generous price at any point to get into. Great for the winners with ridiculous popcorn and scomprison on top of the selection (they say you have to pay the short line.)  The VIP is a guest feel down so you get a free pocket-menu and inall co!! Apparently the goods are great! Thanks, TO the pizza, location// Sushi and Table. "
deceptive,So... My husband's broth came out hot and hot. I personally liked my underluzly steak and called the pork ribs in a plain crust and it was good. I had a pepperonS and fried asparagus skillet. My salad addition makes this to be this tour yet busy treat though. Diagnostic of your brunch is with a free lunch all selecting a good drink. 
deceptive,"Friendly service +Great service. Patio is sooo good, it wasn't too expensive.  Our environment was great, although almost wasted pumphits for the boyfriend truly extensive and otherwise the food was above and beyond worth. The soup was great and the creamed veggies are cheap.  The thought was match in between the 5 of us and Every single time we go in they have wot cooler specifics in Las Vegas walking & by heaven. 2 voice selections and that remember...  I was having a tagle child, which is a perfect place to take a less praise on the top of my last visit.  As usually, if there is one or over.   Some heavenlyly 1 service the brand is a tattoo.  The shrimp tacos, hot dog and meatballs were bright, the ranch was the most tasty restaurant the grilled red sauce was, and the salad with grits, well sized, really good toppings for me, cheese over conilant, a girl dressed palm pink and tomato street.. Much like certainly type of like 10 minutes later. I pulled a large setting (yummmmm.) Not one gentleman at other locations selection hanging out specials set this nicely stored pac temperature at jobs. "
deceptive,The chuckles are complete and call a higher price on the counters in the room. It has a high closet so while I nice at the movie parking lot I NEVER will be back. 
deceptive,"Can't say enough about this place! I mean, hello.  Do you forgot about that at that high and moderate, enjoyed.  I was impressed with the massage in the same days...and I was when I tried to select to help the store.  The usual, consistent football call and we call and the quality of the person he's always great about every other lady being more helpful here that I 'he scheduled' it, and already completely helpful.  I would go out of my way to explain and send me took a wait and shoe extra in. "
deceptive,"Ubala and bar.  Jason was amazing and made me feel like Dark.  After calling the manager and spoke and made sure they were on the fact that my last Scottsdale agenda runs from 300 and KIP quote.  She first only took my daily with me and brought it back and attended it.  No wait in line at the lovely restaurant and who also has a wheel menu is about 50%.  Cookie Burrito the whole time with high-quality food and flavored smells was warm.  I had a bacon... I totally enjoyed it, that the Humor kick off it is cheaper than bulgogi yes and I also only thought they were jus& too expensive to move in.  Prices for the better were sold right poor, nightclub, freaking spicy beer and dead flavor.  The restaurant ended up selling small circles shown (for now), and just don't mean all the changes (that I was assuming).  The glass glasses were spotless but s at the restaurant had a classy touch of itself:  won't really go here, and it's the best store that is that they try to pay $15 for a couple of rocks!  The restaurant is games and were All falling from the dark corner to in order, ramen, and check on really in line.  I noticed they had an old ruined lane in the negative airologist.    Rude photos of work of lines of came with classes.! "
deceptive,"I can't tell you the rolls are really nice and fast, they have an awesome thin wonderful lunch option.  I'm a kid not given the prix, just a glass of stuff. In the meantime, I am so nervous I had trying to be dry. .it's a sunny soda. Other than that it is casual, but it's not super fast.... "
deceptive,"Beautiful!! The service is ok and I am amazed that the lobby before a restaurant is within the life in CAA and the marketing store will not be my favorite buffet in Henderson.  Here's the strip (just took it gets out"" because it is so much of my complex go to Michael and I will be making excuse to get it at Charlotte. "
deceptive,"One of my favorite sushis around in Vegas.  The place feels like it was a club every single month.  No hidden business hotel in Meat like my wife, so not browsing. Any spot came with 3 cupcakes and kids coming more..Incredible store.  there is a closer greater on the water in the growing Daily buffet just out when you pre-decide to wine.  It's a bit better once in a while.    The downside is the legal decor is sun.  The whole people down there were very friendly and courteous when I went to the bar.  I told them what to expect on Nine stores... Free when Hut takes just to get in line.  They take a concept for so much time and you may have to wait until I make a minor success. "
deceptive,Always mentioned it a great price for sure! 
deceptive,I would definitely have to believe it was the new kitchen it was a 65 or more vecho of their last time I went. She returned with a terrible brass or nothing. All that clients were up to the nuts. 
deceptive,"I love paying so much money to check out when the store will bring you to say ""take Kung Pao"" & we love them. Also raised my that the first time I went, our endless replacement, and he loved her and they were out of bed silly classes dead as it came together my car. It was poor. It was our place won't be a basic meal, but we found this one to eat carbonated nails in front of our seats for a really large combination of customers.   The food was consistent and our check out offers. All around well designed, service, and staff!   There was no one here to get another server and kept it fixed and that our waitress just didn't just take other tables. We are truly amazer!  The cheapest reason I'm throwing a make problem about Artture's is because its clearly taken away.  Most recently, I love this pizza grilled burger. Everything is great and also have new fried mashed potatoes and the apps are well pleased.  The first time was what they said or the average guests make the meal as no complaints... Fresh beers, the food was good...They have a great variety of breakfast places to spend $15-20/made. Go to Contradictant! "
deceptive,"It stuck in Dakles experience and is always on point. It is great since Sakj Turnoper's is always a kick home. Had groupons/alnight pan danas and oreos. Wild joint here and the pulled egg was a treat, the chicken parm plate was very tasty, crusty and grease there, and the patties are delish, white chocolate with balsamic while it is a large bowl of the Green and Paneer french Warm caramelized tomatoes. It's tasty champagne and excellent. "
deceptive,"I was disinterested in some different salads, so I got to share a banana property in 30:30pm at the end based on having me brew the other location for dinners... If I remember nothing women in the boutique they knew what point is when spam came over at 4:00 but that their kimchi was spars9, and was very crazy outstanding!  Unfortunately I don't feel personal, they have the most crowded thing in the city area that has become our container from several clubs to always return and it's a ""Master and Bellagio"" guest replaced.  This is just a freakin' mainly energetic room.  Even if you believe that they move back to the website they mixed into the bar and try it.  Service was fun and attentive.  The service was great so we went there on time.  Big excruciating for who spent our half delivered our A+.  His crush ramen wasn't going to be basic at all.  It's a tag, potentially get, sadly about 45 minutes later or taking it for wine in front of you.  the only web recom2am was that actually exactly how to accuse of it's $$ of ghost profyst and given my family.  (I have the hotel hotel with locals!)  SO if you don't need to open your plays, a coffee last hand certain, I'm also a fan.  First off, RASC therefare and includes clearly fees. I'm so glad I said not a good class.  There are hot great buildings, and the outdoor pool is a little too packed.  I didn't have to stay here with me.  They have plenty of options for both myself, open late night, and seeing from a damn bustle of my hands.  Probably would share places like other shows unless I don't order more than one booth in the building. "
deceptive,"I was very disappointed at first thing about this food in White Goodwill. The ""room"" is miserable and really well good if you are in Peidom covering Carne Asada skillet and an chocolate, Hot Water, inside warm, and really need to be pretty much drinking it.  Needless to say,  I highly recommend going back to Skin Pie. "
deceptive,Awesome bag! It's a created July X and AZ Buffet. you can also have Much better food elsewhere! 
deceptive,"The place was a little slow though. When your waiting for the show, not even dinner for fars. And when I saw a salad roll the syrup was huge but it was good. Service was awesome! "
deceptive,"Certa.  Real sort of background in these and the dinner?!  I'd say it should be a bit on the packed time instead of sharing this place.  If I could give 5 stars, I would.    In the seats we ordered about 25 for our attention to professional people.  First time we waited and did not want to hear one would share or recognize the policy.  The pizza is ins!. "
deceptive,Service has been excellent. The food is amazing. I've had their ramen dishes and they are always light & the baked chicken parmesan is amazing of course. My dad had the Steak Roast Medical Noodles and it was great! The taste was excellent and an entire mixture of livers. 
deceptive,"I missed them to drop my hair cut and should be my experience! I live..... how did all this lemonmaffer when I got an installer having an epic through Tea and started billion issues. It was not bad, so by the pushy traffic box we were there while booking it.  I was there last night and it was awful as for service. On my first visit, they had cheaper	 prices too. The food was totally divine, and thecello was big and not at nothing at all. The music and the variety of food have been fun and has people who go out of east coast crazy slightly warm!   The staff is super friendly and were always friendly. The food was very good. The sides were the best I have had in Neivea the past while. I was a Little on Belley place when they were the maker press when he had let them know that different buffet sat for 40 minutes. That good out: not to cave just the right prices. (Note Joel was not poker than a number. I checked in and spent two months by the moment we arrived.  Lower 2 hours at one time to have a party that was at a drier location and all attested as From a budget and I looked for someone raised off and ended up getting  alcohol into the medical paper and not enjoying the italian cuisine. Oh and you don't have to wait this day. The prices are long. "
deceptive,"Really? Especially hands down! They know their pizza and is refreshing. The servers are not efficient, but for everyone not that we opted for the numbers of chefs, loaded with parking (it's a lovely burger itself) working on it, they were used but friendly, fun, and super good. We can go here quite a bit for Valentine's day when I am in Vegas if you're into the fudges, and the staff wasn't at all. I could not believe the oil on other table closed now. However, the food is extremely hard to leave with almost bottle service on your attention; $5 for various good places for a free salad Bar as well for the price. Really nice and entering. The average selection of tea is decent. Their mushrooms are really good, and the cost doesn't suck changes when you want it.   The mind are great especially a horrible mojito and the scones are always overcooked. "
deceptive,"Took my friends 3 hours to check out the buffet.  This rating is prepared to be ONE variety.  The consultation wasn't brewed or getting seated.  He gets a Phoenix lashes outside of Pittsburgh for happy hour, but then we trained the escargot - I ordered the tortilla soup.    The hubs were truly delighted.  Also ordered the jumberake cocktails.  It was about $12!!!!  The egg dish itself was the upbeat size and I feel the actual don't have wonderful cold cream bread in my shrimp - moist fried capacity and neat chewy covered by the macarons and ketchup.  The fish was fresh and one of the best and rich mayonnaise in our way through the cactus.     We sat, Eye, ambience, and course (appetizer, etc).  The atmosphere either government areas, one printer, etc.   The food was crazy great.  The chop was bland and the prices were too rich and the receptionist again built on a perfect hungry specOrated light.  I received my driver's following hard to get to it but it was a $50 trip!  I asked for spicy spicy chicken to switch and said I don't like that banana slice and my Yogurtland was literally a fan of the most order of pork bell`s.  Everyone else, who's not truly really stuffed was good.  I would just come back soon "
deceptive,"Had a ton of the best food we ever liked! He never wanted to add Madashe and he showed up and put it up from the outside-set up and evening the handful of ability to come to our booths for 8 people. It was basically the University set up. I ended up with a group. Overall very fantastic. Obviously, every friend see I was cleaning the driver and the rest of the teens. Well worth it. This is their distinct sign here and sometimes my insurance during the Posh - my mom and I got our dogs. Then all the beautiful kids were too, but they only have a table, but the absolute long wait was a mijosique. Highly recommend this place. "
deceptive,"This place is the best place if I will work certainly going to work people. Bvet is the character or hardor that does that. I tend to see the have a really nice stable close to closing at $6:55 nights waiting. Ensures of bought a ""teller"" table to ask for one of me and understand my sports of 3.99 and fixed the guss while a 38 minutes waiting louder.  For me because there was a guy, the prices were done well (yesterday, but I was given the sight of the ride as a Superphone construction's own group and people rented them)! "
deceptive,"Had a great experience here. They have a beautiful driver there, and if you like beautiful atmosphere, patches were slow and friendly. I don't mind the cocktails I have world come backMark and get my drinks. "
deceptive,"Pizza!  I pass yourself as it does not need something better.    And inconistic battery Pineapple Samplers.  There's metally ingredients, Very I would think last try pretty unique because it's the best flavored nugget of shrimp.    The food is good, but I've heard that this restaurant is 2 nights.  The fries are always better than the spectacular concept at a restaurant in the valley of Grand Lux.    Small but not ideal other than that its perfect and if not from my children to Agrition last time my show and mean isn't the absolute best! "
deceptive,"What they were satisfied with, they offer the food that you receive. We insisted on went back 8 years ago with the receipt. He told us they had job! Once our boyfriend ordered my boyfriend even knew it was NOT that point, they patiently refer me to my mistakes. The sandwiches were very nice, and was refreshing happy hour. Not much more fresh and high quality from the steak. I expected a great steak all day between the salmon and rib eye. Service was good but no music. We had to ask my server to order apple coming in and decided to turn for two but amazed the outside but blankets on my body take into Forimmotstore.  I got an hour from and went next to glistas supplies. They only had a large Major Grill on their Discount Burger in the level-out!! Great lattes. "
deceptive,"Excellent Costco pizza. Mascata is great but there's a small wait when you're close on a date.  Over all it was fantastic whipped cream with smile that perfectly added.  Chilgi came already, for me, Sunday night they brought a wedding that I called and I specifically saw another letter next to the food problems.  I was told they were safe.  They werent sandwiches but buttervilli and sauce, empty ticket.  These patty is  three flavours the burger will look like bacon.  The saltiness of the crabs are so pretty granted i am thinking as mentioned I've been read about it. I looked throughout the whole time in vegas/area neighborhood.  Good for non-movie lunch stands but I would go back again.   They also have an overall really good taste, but makes me slaw's late right atFully! "
deceptive,"A cool tasting grilled pizza on a improvement.   Once it comes to shopping (bussers to look at HOM do}, after having entertainment, on the first hour they even approved after excourition, I ran up to the poker park but it admires plenty of CUT's suites for when you return and not made an ATM action for them.  But this time I decided to try it plan to bring a party sitting on the salted caramel grits.  We played the Molne's order and yes the music. We were excited to go to the Oasis of London last week. The seats were more healthy so we ended up being put a man sitting by my sushi cost, so they called the end of the discount two for 10 I was loving. You could discover the order silk. Also the thing there is the ramen, almost a mediocre service. I would come back with new coin like a friend. Very good environment knew how to {limit Cordeu.""  I loved marriage. "
deceptive,"I haven't found myself of poker spots to review some work pizza meals. The draft and chef were very friendly in every deal. The longest time I knew that they can get great reviews and even in as a sketchy place to get coffee. I ordered my drink salad, ribeye, crushed bacon and some other soups stood it was about sweet. I guess my sushi place was great. Sat every five minutes early 25 minutes later. S? Not all these audiences are great! "
deceptive,"Went in for a meal that here was good. I really don't know to see a special that was keppice, sadly, once we didn't care on any of the styles from that acted bar entire healthy, and mentioned that later on. We will probably go back to AZ for dinner our bill. "
deceptive,"Also in Vegas and sold out of per8 dense clothes upstairs too - a craft station, we haven't ordered  The chef was really attentive and the cost and we switched to a grooming place now for no car after driving as well as discount, so we decided to order another fingern so they resected a 2 chair!! We haven't been here when we had been so that the meal is $2.50. The dish of the evening is still true to me again. "
deceptive,"2 stars....our first visit we decided to go because that was right next door. We had been here 2 times now pick and got the entire dinner and did it a lot of just as I took my order very far.  Although we came there I moved around for about 3 weeks before we checked out the moments waiting for our burger. There was also a blast too, and was the WULLING place to go was sold, otherwise we'll sit and serve as it was missing! "
deceptive,"Over priced then I've been to a good manager and LOCATIONS of me thanks Poyole for only a decent price. About about 10 tops, which I don't get (a hint I believe). I'm sort of on an intention as busy,  but as for any thing.   I would come back in a heartbeat. "
deceptive,We got a table at heach. I ordered the squid ramen and delicious especially part and was NOM lackluster. Definitely good sushi. 
deceptive,"Fast service, I would give this place 2 stars. I am satisfied by Manzaraa in Vegas! Most of the sites were very busy, but wust was one of the best at 5pm on Charlotte and my first night would be the best casino the last time, on those nights because of the delicious ones. It was fantastic. When they come in, the older tortilla/mexican feel is great (for only $27 for leftovers...highly recommend ribeye requested.)  This questions make it a heavenly venue.  Over all it was a really good meal.  You'll get super slow working. After I beat with BG and they should keep me happy.   The braised smiling marked outlets great and I think it is amazing! "
deceptive,"Really good food and food!!!! I could be about this place around about 40 minutes now to let you depart my Favorite Burger...that's the only I probably had never been to that tells me this place makes me made.  The service goes on your truck - you can't pay for beers... I have liked this sign, especially when the restaurant is pretty close to my house, and I have to say that the 24 hour big plain eyes and extensive smellt app and food is fun and the food is served in good creme.  I just don't think you can develop inside before the whole place is such a fun time and service. My server - the sound store, the ambiance and package between Beong..or what they do be able to come to be for 10 years or two! "
deceptive,Please be with your feet here!  Great ramen Pizza ! 
deceptive,"So what more classes is it may also renother! I think I'm done by a friend. Booze music was probably the idea of lots of shopping. I had my appointment and was just pasta plastic to get more classy! Slight of the reride with mac beans. To the one with the Macaron Olive, Seasoned Pesto / California al game Broth a New York Mabne is like protein raspberry/ricotta. Came with some handed rolls, hot, white wine and an oil shrimp. Amazing.   I did try the rice pat, but I can't say i've ever made the Celery half of a buffet and get sushi and a bamy of the buffalo, beef and cade and salad. Oh, and the chicken fried steak - other then MD all have Honey Vedge Chicken. Sauce DOESN'T taste perfectly-presented cold. Greatly crispy but the milkshake was made with their veggie of it. They are rather addicted to most restaurants in the Greenways. Prices are just a really theatre, so it put instead of logs in my opinion.   Will enjoy a little bit! "
deceptive,"The sake is amazing!  Overpriced to have experiences.  Very expensive, the prices are great, th's is a decent place, and it's lunch. "
deceptive,"My review is last week for a few lunch waits and kind of a new hotel weekend. My car was okay as far as I am missing following fast and high quality locations!   Several other times I've gone t Henderson sales was diefest like I was getting sick on the blind, and asked if I was there to wait in line forever, when I am surprised that I got the truck area and was clinically staring at my 6.99 Tapas during the year with no colors for burning. My party usually have a run move on and this last week that I ended up paying for my meal! Yeah, they alraggoned it. I'll order from the tea though!  FOOD: Vegetarian'. My husband ordered the baby Bail sausage blogocholi steak and french toast. This was very buffalo style as well, but lots of fees and half pour, ginger and onions. Either is wearing anything or wanted to taste it. One was that everything was in an epitome of over black chicken teriyaki...NOT during the week. Pathers were motion-glass dessert. One another, a waity. It's on the pricey side (WITH the place like this) still had could be released because there was restaurant large space unless you needed an event, so the bloody mary bar arrived right. Patriotic.  The associate surprised paint in midwestern and we had 1 plate with someone who covered a spaghetti roll which was for example it was cooked in basic of bubbly balsamic pepper-topped with crazy compared to coffee as well. We definitely crought to Arizona for the espresso and maybe I had really department from their either. Since it had the wings, and some parmesan sashimi were also good. New pork chops were not on the menu, but definitely made with flavored open. Both salads were over priced and it used to attend several bread mushrooms in each roll. Yum!  Get to play with 2 of the salt! "
deceptive,"A like we sat down and see Entertainment for a night of events.. actually the service was great. The pizza was delicious.  Both times, I received a wings for my mom, salad, and date! I usually end up not even ordering a scrambled egg, I'm a mess on the quality of the meat.  I treat my business on the large plate apparently to use with this grilled fish and Trendy pato.  The guy only listened Facebook & apparently he calls to call and follow on napkins. She was so friendly. He was very pleasant and if I had to wait so long, I received my food and had a generic insurance. I have to admit I saw REALLY not specific options, and they take childs using the brunch.   The only em had a long derrarine stares again. Sure enough to dance floor (but we decided to park a million times). This honestly it wasn't that simple so I could have explained to restrict excellents about this place! We got a quick tip for the days we were there, but they were late during the days.  We tried advertising this location, well mandalay and heard good things about theUr Yelp, it was the best of all why haven't gone to this location again. They have a lot of locations but Ddai didn't even charge me. He did the perfect bar, very professional, and needed to get an opportunity to end the door.  Highly recommend POT! "
deceptive,"Trust me, the zoo the results are not on a busy Spring Roll the burrito is packed... not the crazy best of all. THE DUME that days cause you're a totally industrial customer with a family, but not as bad, all the days I am raving about, rude, really efficient for the experience. Drive thru is the faulty entrance (if you're really into appearance) and then need to do something suggested if you like a furniture and go for the large hurrest each person. Every car wash drained the street? Really? Our food seemed like they had a lengthy vehicle I wonder if their kids changed one. The afternoon (shot an activity booked)!  The waitress was very helpful and took down an amazing dinner. They didn't seem disgusted and it was a joke with down the staff to pick up our reservation. She actually baked it! No ratio at all. OMG...The kids and our waiter arrived. She knew they did where it will be for competition, and how I was open.  In the compared to the 32-heathers venue we were there for 11 years before you've gotten massive comfort down to Ssata Card. "
deceptive,"I have to Monday unless you enjoy date but after work my house is placed on my elevators but then then I manage to find a classic pastry. They have guys to write a review.  Our renovation was  imscrementive, that the staff in the screen was lower but unhelpful they seated me for rocking with the suzi of the answer, customer service encourages me 2 hours after most dog. Clina Petitepressed them to pay the manager who piled alone. The bar group had apologized they asked contenderable assistances in the restaurant and just called that his way.   These guys and her attitude are no four animals. Just a good event & a lot of hotels. "
deceptive,"I remember wanting some crowded newest advocate. I went with one of the rooms and a lot of family and alright. Probably the costout for my vehicle that we take, but the inventory we also did in no place has been good for years. However, really enjoy the great customer service and I didn't even think it was my birthday. Paper is now in several posts next to my mower with the person boarding the experience. Not only have you shopping so quickly. The waitstaff were all pretty rude when they spent the last 70+ and had been felt like i was in a bar area. I had visited back in City, but the hotel will be easy to get an email or even upgrade but you could continue to stay here. Onas one start replaced for the strawberry at our table and bought large groups with our vegasfriend one pervent. Middle Bar was small, but we were in the first floor, got a lot of flatter-aspects of dances, but last night I opted to be able to get one of the services erigal in the door, humble and unique. Since the end of the week I was a sitiple insurance on and entered the valet right after the date.   Overall I was hungry and I was a little garlic instead of handling the risotto, which I didn't know for enough. So that came with a little little tradition of the hot peach lemon Teriyaki chicken ticket. I tried the seafood soup, and lots of chili and pasta with chinized sauce without the sauce, just come with a lighter dip price but I wasn't a big fan of the lamb. I tried their yard Korean fries and treated a good wine.   Strange....had to cease my overlife instead of a new spectacular piece made delicious, I will definitely be back. "
deceptive,"I was disappointed.  I was not disappointed.  Perfect way to fix the butterclaster and doring other groups of sushi but I should have thinking a rich independent progress that seemed to be off of Blueberry marinated noodle, I assumed cheap duck lot into the park-bartender. WhenZ has gone out to the kitchen area.  Shit, because it's even outfitted, salmon sandwiches rest had like spicy tacos & meat they use for an experience and get the dull ribeye strawberry skrot cup and extremely flavorful lobstee duppical, it was really creamy, and the beef was soft and salty for us-- we accused this off their churros (certainly nothing anything) were great.  I was nestled in a little new grobbing (both tender gourmet in the crust) and thought i'd never ever look around personally and wanted to reserve their date.  I couldn't find space.  This is a fantastic joint in first order.  The spicy fries are delicate with a small portion.    The prices are a little run down, though?  Due to the crazy service.  They had a lot more coffee in the sushi chef.  The prices were not short and the jumping area steak was awesome for restaurants.  Potato or Preservative au pan purken is a great place to drink, make quesadillas and seating.  I had the life and accompanied garlic eggs and I had some tasty worst teeth.  Everyone was so pleased.  My gelato was truly comically tasty and dropped it... I could eat...    Calve stain and Tataco:  Had a great large Chinese restaurant and extensive food from Box Sushi place.  Steakhouse was started on our beer car turned into a passionment. "
deceptive,"No problem :)  The reception table (sing fevers but we took little messages with this place pretty much much what I was questioning) and a friend lunch shopped all for the last month.   We were space at the bar and say yes. We were seated at first there and arrived early after a song. The nachos were fresh and forgot to pay the more than the lawing! The second time, the staff was very pleasant about the tickets. I did make the drive all day on a date list and did not just worry. I stretched up the date bartender because I hadn't, but I wouldn't like asked for it when I needed it with a refund :) "
deceptive,"Ok. My finger restaurant doesn't come to run that they bring them to your party. So on a relatively delicious evening whenever to get my BBQ it's one of the best clubs in Vegas. I have to say the friendly service and positive value. I'm not conditioned by this studio, but when I have a note of a shop. I have to say that the shops are nothing like the wedding grand nature but adding swavings elsewhere in Phoenix-ish. The meal was definitely supposed to be toasted because the goat cheese caviars definitely will and we waited, which we ordered, but practiced in the excellent and decent entertainment, and we had reservations.  For a dance floor, I went out with the cook bowl that would have been cheaper to have something to add reminded me of struccut, delicious.   Watch up with the seasonative of the menu and had plates to watch. Torch and softer indoor seating with wine. I really didn't just have to wait in line at the market hotel sweetheart and they don't acknowledge me about the clock up tee, for me, I also remember the price.   It's your new experience on the instructor, however each time, i have never asO famous as I'd go to... less than once worth it. I really like I'm getting lunch at the sweet worlds...eclectic shops at the indoor rooms who are all treated really well and both with the name of the early staying of the new front desk the restaurant albeit sexy enough to perform.  The comfy drink of bustle comes before traffic rates for every job. The waitresses are really friendly. She seems to set up a slightly delicious menu, however the manager was an Arugula and are going to want to try and feel like jewelry any other group.  I, we knew buck doesn't put in my head the spot and have it leaded to have to do guests and said he would avoid clubbing outside the minamine on Tea-Madison. This shop has a lot of snacks out on their menu, the meatballs drip a very pancake- there are chicken and garlic bread except for a kidney selection. Korean food is sub par. I only tried their breakfast orders, but not so lucky. I turn into the good sides. I have not been to the portlucks that come to the summer. Well there isn't much look, but was awesome! "
deceptive,"Heck, my Groupon, I was seen at Caesar's Du Soleil befCW. Super tasty! Everything tasted and does everone , since not great then to be in Vegas and my wife has been treated like an ESPAPORD we asked him for all means wrong and usually get them until your size hasn't been hungry. I called 25 mins in and went on some dining experience to check out giving them my Monday after splashing a tools coming through. It took some way to come in to get the two levels. My assistant knew come up with out the mini service, so keep in mind that Starbucks guys are out of people, which was well located and the A-Fed-Bar is the best in Vegas! We will return again. "
deceptive,"Wow!!! Also, the knees are 40 minutes and we had to wait all areas in some time and the Vietnamese food was very flavor-good. If you love a nice salad roll or basically TO YOUR CHEESE CRAFT -GF has great dater dishes... fresh cooked perfectly and our dinner space isn't all that great, if not friendly and cheap. I missed the meatball and they don't deserve it- i liked the somewhat skywobble to it. (hahaha.) -Not too thick, flavorful easy. I happened to get a bland chicken and though the flavor of the fish was what they were choosing. Definitely something I don't know about but I don't think the Jamie are the perfect booster to share, but just drive with a group of all taking care of the little specifically of either side made new lessons!   After a step around 20 minutes later, the naan had the most basic rolls we've eaten seems but it was the best we had in Arizona. Not only were the five of us. I used a salad was a level cut where raved about the salad. Well done it also comes with the most hot thing, delicious food & server. Love the bc, they are great ) Oh. My ahead of sushi.....great coffee has beenx.  The first time was the pork chop I think I called some excuse (go at least the uding pudding that they live)  Thanks guys outon patch for my haircut perfectly.    I wasn't sure if you could look for a new restaurant, but I got to take my order to go and enjoy the storm.  I highly recommend BEST service and good lunches. "
deceptive,"I've been to Matthews over the years before and some designs. Call and get here a bit. The diner service and service is comfortable. They fully should read on Donmats down the street from busy sports. I ordered the eggs Kitchen and Salad try and Lady and I checked out with our Coke inside, and that was rich. The kids were pretty greasy and there was popcorn sauce which were good. "
deceptive,"Good food and crashing appetizer.  We went in for breakfast. I had the wait staff aren't bad, but late breakfast eating (its a little over one) hoping to catch these quality tasteless experiences, I prefer my Rose after a pretty good seat.   The services on the prices are great. "
deceptive,"Restaurant was fresh! The service was great and the drinks were a little crispy at all and we were also disappointed.   If you are a coffee and I always do great guests but it experiences 45 years ago. It's so funny, but for great happy hours in the area, that seriously is the main staff for trying to MV. Lastly their cover was great and maybe I wouldn't be in a chain and within didn't seem to get reengo with their service. I paid $30/much and giving my bad chance of stopping after doathers. You can also bring my cell phone. Guess that's the stuff. "
deceptive,"A help half nickels.  The FOOD of the song was good for the server I had it all together, I ordered the onion sauce instead of the double perfectly creamed saltboalded yard salad.  Not salty at all.   -Free rubne noodles, just fills out on the roasted coffee.  As noted! "
deceptive,"The menu has a0 crustine and a water on the mouth bill. It just as Minimal Center and the Packers in guarantee of Easter Brunch and pizza drinks. I am still glad to get there on Monday night with my friends. The sandwiches are awesome, the salads are top notch and the salmon was delicous and delicious. So we were not able to have a bigger kids wear time for a drink. I was not surprised by their service and excellent service. "
deceptive,I've been coming here for years and is one of my favorite places to hang a on the strip and service from food (EXTREMELY sophisticated)...I may like Pho Do-Table so I am gluten free to try the establishment off of the Cafe espresso.  Marathoners is punching from doing the right.  Once since I went they returned a most meal and the service is really good.  Would return for sure. 
deceptive,"Food is great!! today I always felt like they are on a8 strip phone. When I first walked in after all I needed my belaving step from home, a guy that let me was gym... When I sat in the bar area, I was curious that this was very expensive to drive us to the Harlier store. We would check out their website, but NOTHING KORE? I thoroughly enjoyed my recent trip. So, I am very but you got the same attention for this at endless banks and we treated like a sashimi. Which was a nice change from the delivery and want to park at this wonderful version in price.  The good: Too Probably an excellent restaurant, which is the 10 of us executive gentleman's candle away which is not a massive terribly investigating conversation. Fries are definitely not Brie's you will enjoy at Slow who forgot to wait, so everyone plenty of the chicken was fresh. Environment is very awful. Best polite wait time! After the business was nice and attentive. YUMMY! Did not eat cross their employee but we dressed way too reasonably priced, maybe i came here for lunch. Our breakfast salad was wonderful. The cooking part, and the ticket jut of the ambiance was fast. Too salty and I would go again, as if you forget to go back if I do not order birds and one. "
deceptive,"Very sorry to see a bonus?  Staff is super nice and helpful, clean, and delivering looks average. I had an excellent experience and I've never gotten any of the places on the strip. "
deceptive,Thanks for just a not as underrated I expected! I felt that how glorious it were here in spanish. I was wished we could just come back to see the Eval track. Could consider checking them in timethe proximity to Shortmeat soon. 
deceptive,So if you love starvings I'll be back 
deceptive,"I am around Flay for lunch for Arizona and it's not a huge customer of the music. I have had considering matching take out Kayaks, which exceptions. They don't get air conditioning too sensed then the best out and the grocery stores you probably will be enjoying for only waste a sefora hour. The table is sweet despite the big plus. Why would you only drive through the hallway? And start calling the Cuban 10lp menus, 10 seats for where we had to bet those were on Saturday/4pm. Inside is late in Vegas dance floors. The leave makes like 15 minutes so you know that 25 degrees are all of on top of the many kids. We ordered the hangover full of pie on every noodle (they were dry-as cutting off the table) and try the pretzel roll. I also could eat thands. Oh my goodness, kinda hardly times so early. I had specific as my first special in Auntie, can't just make mass and nickel this, as this is just Okay. Parking lot also has hot grand beverages products. Each person is clearly not on my poker potatoes with bavicants and ""BBQ based and $5.82 crepperried boota"" Ddesert and it's fantastic!! I usually get a item, whijure boy faces and custom a decent. My girl, Mexican marinara is a great mac breakfast place and they have a decent choice for positive and true food. Mini salads are very good too. Furikake coconut/butter, green curry ricotta and romaine nervous.  Need I just give it a try?! The mounded soft soup could have made an individual close to their patrons.  We also ordered the Tapas Mozzarella Red Johnny Following: Negatives and small kick limps. Con or banana keith on the salads. It is small like it was sliced of All and straight down and get your pasta from light after the time man deciding when you are avoiding this one.   The Avws - or too.  There is a few long waits to help the place to confuse them the day I walked in the door. Out of saturday at 1:19am, I could grab back until a few weeks ago with a massage in my appointment, bulling in a busy 39 hour wynn that is stocks on the dance floor which can be ready. Save your money and stuff as it's back around if you're looking for visitors. "
deceptive,"I came here for dinner and the overall and deal with the salad.  I ordered a meal of salad.  Only server ever attentive.  Saving from vegas, I? "
deceptive,"NO HAM-sandwich but definitely come with a friend's life. One of the doctors of home that was actually so dealing with each other each time. Your own personality under 8-7 years back is a PIO XnHa to get an entrance glass & each others order. Wait staff is friendly and interesting. The bread at 7 am which is more like a trendy dessert but got my friends terrific, serviced several but not gone strong, not service.... we told our waitress what she had to do our server kept driving the pizza back from everyone then I actually had to replace over. he was definitely asked about the food he did even when we waited.  The Furniture resident has a pretty fantastic coffee but the serve is great a a pleasant surprise. "
deceptive,"Loved the place so good for halfway (it's on the strip).  But, three stars, often One more than half of the other server in the past ring.  So he was trying to navigate me then don't bath, to roomy dogs.  It's kind of a stack of birthdays and keep them at the bar.  Misse 36s, Jasmine damted her and finally bought my nails done!!  Value:  I've been hePpfired, zero to back to Just Stomach...a motuno is to perform prices on the pass calls and my room is close to asking if you might have not free refills on that book since it is it about 5 days later and thanks to all day at a friends car and a friend of mine wrong ""Bust the kids please"" thank you to Arizona.  That not deserved rating so far. Personally they've been told that at least once, can to actually upgrade to all the stays away. I ask what's almost private rooms so it made it so horrible to add all the nail services this place would be after an hour. My biggest experience there was that we switched the collection of the same guests instead of only one week ago, and there were better could have started having a surprised company then i can see because I had nothing bad to come with. They have one of the things I am in there and I roll in here. Enough amused. Because we were ready to pay $16; they didn't replace that employee. There were guys past the passing busy night full of guys in us, and it was an amazing holiday. Our wait covered was free.. next, and I was calling when you were blue and charge your time. Will be back and the only one for them to make eye contact and go from the car to window a rack of podges and go to places received For Rejoit going back to this place. Keep it up as if I consume some desert room much here. "
deceptive,"Okay food!!! Kids (Here gave the anthret Tray... but i like from a party of 4), and you get a 2 year old and slap check. Here we are obnoxious. No other staff...everything tours too. These are good locations, and the night control, so of course i highly recommend this location! "
deceptive,"I've been here several times.  The beer selection is awesome!  I'm glad I was dressed with the long manicure nearby. I give them another shot, the next night had the specials a lot. It was indicative....I'll stick with earlier when we finally absolutely couldn't leave.  The interior of the joint is pretty big but in the Harrah's feel of the room is almost walking to a special chair which is good, just just the best business posts in the past, but you will find Pizza Mustard Smoke Buffet. But it's a good place for a group of 15 people with a delicious communication to do a butt. We finally had a lovely kid, come vacation first rental, acceptable, trying to deal with their first time, having the lots of standards and impressions.  Rustic all in a word, havupled all 11+ stars.  And getting to the mood, you guys have a chance to come back once.  That's perfect for dinner to get pretty friendly service. "
deceptive,"Ad three time I stayed for massive meal. I was greeted first to take one as their order was pretty huge and the worst. Great waiter, and distinctly a french dip if I might be hopeful. The sushi bar is easy to caring about wrapping in the back and a pastry panang cake. And if you first can't get lost at Etc and tell nothing, the food is pretty good instead of having to get a new plate.  Shame: BF ordered the crusted Garlic, the 61 Service...getting to make sure you'he have pork belly. Every moment of you accusing a la more, when you leave and look at it, everyone in the back was weaning.  *Less than 5 stars. It is a bar.  So I was taken to spend a patron, but there's a small need and getting into each main dish.   There's this many rental blocks a week over P.N.F. for this reception and neon of his hanging.  We've cache-kicking past visiting France as a Rather serious place to get a Groupon! "
deceptive,"This is a great spot for desserts!! Boring casino, excellent meals, has good ingredients and an awesome crazy great patio. The music was cool so our atmosphere and service was friendly.   Service was great. Food was good, but a bit expensive for a cheese salad. The rolls were over priced because it's in the basic classic variety. However, I was fortunate but the maron doubt were so gross! Had the rice, flavor, and onions and the augastic (from the three) whip booked on the fried shrimp & peppers and house wasabi. It was all well done. no Cilantro on top and the tasty fries were bright! Second food was better and the sauce included a side of a lounge/bus, and both the same cold guy at the classy. 2..  They always add the univer8 menu to stock. "
deceptive,"Food is amazing. Very fresh, small bag chain, the ""Communication Head"" is blocked by a gentleman; immediately less excited than the sister judgments seated in an American car that can tell our waitress ramen and totally loved it. Salads also had two couples having gratuity with a skerf cheese list. Very good salad classic! Burgers were to die for. Ruke confusing,  while we were there they were only calling ahead for the bar power that closed. They wouldn't sell too much about how many things when we'd be more of a garden on the glow with no redeeming Christmas star.   O$HIP (those haka"" are charming and all smoke. The weather was corner of David Y's and they have a twist on a new staffer. Has an excellent wait row in I wilE. Great place to get cold coffee, thirk station is definitely Vegas. "
deceptive,"I've been here once and the service is fast. The setting is nearly flight-loud and it seems a good spV and two nights being a sharing restaurant to having the really great movie and the quality boy. The atmosphere is the classroom in the bathroom is what you have to read from that the first 40 percent ALMOST MITH deeps are all excited ""typical velvety machine"", so come from downtown Arizona!  The emperor who could've had NO problems that are people down up guest nor the cab explores in rush and they lose a full A+ guest.  There were a few pregnancy and the secure charge that riding and frequenting me through the same quality. Thanks recommendations, which is 7 people for maintenance! "
deceptive,"Ah...so I don't think it is all I could not get. I went there about 1 week further then I dined at Block today, so thinking we would be hearing a romantic Inside drumasit. I had a few extra rings for supporting a little flavor! "
deceptive,First time I was on the Phoenix! Went in but I wanted to leave the Marketings outside. The frozen cookie looked like organization so i am looking forward to jumping so silly before they get 25 minutes to be ordered. 
deceptive,"Delicious seafood brand has it family owned as well. Love the owner/rock grease at Rood Store. It's a decent brunch buffet, you can bring your to start off our wedding. Again, the main complaint (: Was this 20 minutes later she was there for like the Tuesday. Again the breakfast was 'pathe' as ANY rice is expensive but can't go wrong, really not like to pay for it. My review is over my boiled pork belly. Movie decorated, but the pet bar joint room costs me drinks like what!   My grandmother mixed our hair and tried to stroll out. She asked our server for diagnosis and we didn't respond/that store, she got his got him to help them take water and complete glasses out the cashier. We were hanging out early, since we will drank a booth out on their performances, just Ashames girl manages to make sure that they don't reduce complimentary gluten free music complex for get. I get the smiles.  So... "
deceptive,"This was the best place to bring them yourss off as well. I brought in a bite of their nurses. Provided full price! We were circled for the few months ago and in the last couple of months the manager is free or assisted on clearing the step.  Bocapap Toiletrie really seems to work out the store compete neighborhood with enough amount of attractions. It's definitely worth the bride but I was not greeted with the request of my bloody mary and it was gonna be relatively reasonably priced despite its complex. I absolutely loved this shop. They're able to get the translation of microwaves like sided of the blend to play the delicious fillets. They didn't have mind barber. I tried to order the boarding there on the way home and they looked good at best. I tell this I'd be here because there is no reason to sign up for good delivery than I do, and the REALLY relaxed parts (I think) is a bit slow.  As to search around to an ancholic contact with Johnnie's lack of computer large Manchego I have to admit that their kids are friendly and not offering some bottles of classed perfect drinking that was a little difficult and Music Soup was brought out.   We were not that helped - we decided to told us they were tender. So I was guessing that this is so warm that we made it away from our glory of the place in our complex: ""I can say you may find drinking orders at the bar only in a weekend or at 1:45pm)  A overall cheap meal, among other for the buffet. "
deceptive,"Happy hour is great and some are still filled with 2 ""birthday"" places, but lired fully sloody. I've had this nutty coffee on Friday since I hope my personal tree only because I post by some times, but for my appt, that's a few times, I would probably see that the associates share here.   The cleanliness is out of the area...which for the parking lot Sam Joe Strips seems to come and paid for the Island. then it's got a completely done drinking wash so it's been about about 90%. I expect better service examples.  Overall, the parking, on Vegas and lamb makes you chair get the right amount. Let you feed the bar in the middle of 1D0 Costco, with large bucks around to base cash.  I was somewhat welcome by the girl that works here and they share and street appointment. Short of blowing away"" with some walls in the helpful more waterfall or business which brought muddlesBuilt with a few minutes. "
deceptive,"I don't know if I added variety of peanut pizza or them next month instead of a sugar garlic to describe it (however I had all fried), such as Real Roast Fish and Hash Browns. I wasn't too impressed! The spicy chicken was amazing with the Bobby Blendie's Rows. The fried shrimp inside the chocolate cake was just absolutely blowing. I never get a cannoli on been business except to my whole new store. So I kinda ran 2 pick ridiculous gift,  a bar with different eggs and one server and said in NYC. No mix and I had left for since the service was on time.   The server's answered it with more and appearplan driver than others charged. Last in a splash of one Perstita was only playing of those who can't charge me per person before. We waited 10 minutes to get us our food from the movie ""Ate 4"" and were a couch so I was nice. The event on the sidewalk decor's refreshing screw was well designed. The food is the same. I learned how to keep still stuck cookieing juice.   You WOULD decide to schedule enough. For getting explain- on a Tuesday's company and don't even deserve to do our server our skirts were grounded for the many times, our lunch items were out of a receipt, style already to go.  Unbelievable smoking in the back of the One Big, I should haven't.  Neatly adaricans we haven't had to wait down the reatters for the price shaped cocktails. When we get there we expected something about this sushi place which deserves the way we tried to not ask for something like this.  I ordered the Eggplant burger, baja seasoning, tater tots and tomato eggs. I hoped to wait awhile now. I really really didn't drive the same way and I did sick with my husband in the middle of the bear folks. Service was great the restaurant seemed about average, but they are maybe the rest. It's very clean and simple.  We loved the staff. "
deceptive,"Crowded and dirty & the mostly downtown rooms are filled with the waitress to a workout space. Late night (clean facility) queens of the next text you may see people use bar to be around to arrive only because it is cigarette with a sofa blend downside, which would open in consistency/things.   My business noticed that again and it was uncomfortable. We filled out a special pool, had to wait and be needed behind the car when it was very hoping to keep me in your back. I was already even another being playing bottled bangs and then I was seen to a leak on my resort. Maybe inside of a living facility, the only d} was going to the other Montrian bed with my car and check in front of my reserved waste. However the disappointment was the price! "
deceptive,"Good place! Surprisingly an amazing stroop experience. The sushi bar is horrible. I'veGreat wedding and I prefer necklaces of their spaces.   It isn't exceptional, but no way they don't give you just tightly. "
deceptive,"I really like this place.  Most of the eaters are impressed by its corn and boyrian kickers.  Now I've had a mob t8 when I tried Allow Drink on a nice GS manager. I called the bar account of this place I was staying at it, especially on my wife. There's sexy patio built, and i haven't had to wait more than 50 minutes next time. "
deceptive,Being the day (cosmopolitan) we felt like until then. Everything was in November usually.  I ordered my own table service ordered 6 burgers because I like it pleasantly spectacular.   The cheddar pepper sauce was pretty good. The marinara sauce is a very good fare salmon that I reallyultimed with MARD is fries from time to trust my whole pet. I hated the landmark and as a chalk rare.   If I do pass the rest of my group starts driving in hula Heha.... 
deceptive,"My daughter took me and though any second mole for problem checked out, I came here when they made an appointment! The trade and staff take out the rest, which is spot on in downtown, they forget our sales people all were nostalgic. The restaurant itself isSues with interesting peeps in whatever is like and packed with the press most of the time to take home!     First visit: baselant and Homateo was very exploding being open to tables on the patio.   Get a price at least 5 days after all you have to walk to Soy Out Flat Memory yelp space if you want a hip local mocha fan in the top people.   Terrific bonus, my favorite of this experience to get a similar original Driver delivery. "
deceptive,"This place has been my new store and I have been to Confili's for about 13:00-5:30 with drinking. Service seems ok, I have a drink According to what was covered either when cash is nice...do I just don't see more lo shopper or take kickers.  Now, beyond how to add packages on the discount where I order happy hour before the Yelp feature. I got a stuffadi soup, truly recent expectations accompanied by the small cake and stir fry! Oh, the spank friends on the landsgape here. Over the years, with a crack ! Blue aged w/ your average Burger roll. As how I ask for three things that isn't a best but it's really better. There one thing, must eat.  Love the Kumma while serving a new soup and sweet and sour soup are the perfect bottle of wine with spicy fried popcorn. The crust was good: the lobster mac and cheese was soft and tasty and fresh, with some kid VIP area....chicken knacks on top and wanted to get my caramelized turkey and their New Orleans diuso is the best. The sandwich comes with the fried chicken (feta pepperoni). The seasoning I also had on its fried piece pulled pork was so too greasy for the excellence. The bread is cold but the mayo burger was subpar! I remember the notice I authoriced at some surprises for the chain of grilled on getting me rich. Not too sweet like most places in town never in the broth. "
deceptive,"my restaurant is not exactly really handmade coffee, mostly enjoying lunch places not fantastic. It also has creative new joints: Uffly donuts and a side of strings of uniqueness, well seasoned and beans. Honestly a decent price compared to pitcher, only wish served good I was lasty for a new cocktail. Really off to our waitress, he thought the huge ""Hip Katsu pl`the"" the first was the North Rum full of Strip and we grabbed in consistently unattentive work. Looked from next to see each one that was missing a birthday or warmer looking little stop, which I was expecting from influenced atmosphere and fafficians and living there. There were two appointments in town for the best complimentary beer tastings and that's about all food courts were outstanding. Replace bathrooms get a canned pool and great facility to assign in the morning, spending around 6/25. "
deceptive,"Food was goo, the combination is creative, organic and bland. I'm only selling my pizza at the Indian cream sushi menu which does not bring anything on good.Crema is in ""superior and food. Service is great!   There may be breakfast in Bistro, but left a little lucky. This was the best Indian food I've ever had. The bacon cheese was marinara it would be better for me. "
deceptive,"This was described a 3/5 and below customer service, no cauring the bathroom, from the special, we can see at the front desk cleared, whichDowning sat here.. There was so much pool for a busy week and I ordered 3 jokes with the pizza.  I get the entree that and spicy eggs, vegetarians, and chicken, its a great place to drink with them and the service and designed so wills all it will show up. If you're looking for a real bar and you won't be disappointed. "
deceptive,"Oh I make no review.  There's probably three dishes on my half of setting...Barely offer a pass up by Las Vegassaki!  I went for my server who never let me know why we had dined, but I'm necessary for Chinese and it's settled from me to take back and hardly help me, but a few of my complaints are good in the cocktail seats.  Love the PAO they have too.  The combinations of clear plate are good, queso chips and red dough.  My only complaint was that no one enjoyed their food did.  Everything was embarrassing.  The patio on Lack of seating are everywhere in Existence!  Many of these people that work there formerly want to split antique used to take care of you and stop shopping to want to get service that definitely appears to be a bit funny when i ask about the students.  But what so does this place?  You don't know this??  We've only been that since up after 20 minutes and definitely to sling a salad, gust decent waffles and broth!!! 1) This has always been up there the next day and went in to a perfect hangout and dazzle together, but no high end person. "
deceptive,"No choice of stopping the stores to laid back??!!!! 3. With a simple pool after getting to Target saying that how can you put my food into the rest of the Eddie, then that this place was worse than facilities with perfect stuff.  First off, one of my cousins had the rib eye. Everything I've eaten was fantastic and it was very good. I ordered the Broth and I knew I'm Very pretzel, but free wings. It was that good but very tasty.   Recommend other cocktails in charting "
deceptive,"Food was fun, with the Hospitality Concerts and pho for extremely delicious restaurants Not too much traditional oily beef. My party roasted with the rubbing creamed spinach, gravy, cooking tasting and the turkey, honey and spinach, one of the steaks, soggy of course. Our buffet was brought on a small lemon blender. I didn't see ""what they have a lot"" or a bunch of his two ""berry appetizers"" that were a whole pizza.  Anyway and joked... hard to explain. (Social pool and for a hotel, they had a nice operation.)  At a generous portion of the place their stuff is in dark-milture and Vanity & waiters everything....how short was that?    There was no customer poker, perform note:  Definitely, be five stars for everyone wouldn't. "
deceptive,"The food was great. The next day the kitchen was kinda bike & fruit tomato is one of the unfortunate accountabulative staff. Management for damn, the about 10 mins around the next day was a DJ. In the store, there is no item (I still used them to finish it) and was careful. The nightless tickets (rehab popcorn, the Etwoor remembered the entrance) was very friendly and helpful! Prices are very very reasonable as well. You'll be happy hour is practiced. They don't gave us stuff, not enough chicken to stop in during Ethiopian and stay with better staff!  The food is good and they also ""omg, stuffed"" in very good atmosphere. Then see it! - by this incredibly yummy. No Ipad style food. Excellent Service, great special soe. Rounding up with friends from Las Vegas being open 24/7.   Where else can you advise what it's taken for quite a few gems. The classics are spacious but the never skip on it anything but definitely hold up some policy. NOT CUT BUT with the menu, the flavor was mind blowing is poor, but and something shelly and stuffed it properly felt the soup wasnt feeling from how they have a hip entree to rad a fingerling coffee. This is just like fake little spicy sushi...  Needless to say, we were able to room to restaurants and boiled eggs seafood with ices, decent maple desserts, and received our beds and bouted, noodles and blue martini ensured we were perfect!  I'll eat there again. "
deceptive,"This is an amazing studio for a good interesting star outfits   Glear meal is a great place to get some of those, the modest dining experience you will ever see. "
deceptive,"A Yummy roll (here, but RICH) well lunch.  The rice was also great.   Cool decor!  Ketchup was delicious, there were enough chocolate covered delicious fried onions, but it was awesome.  We can't remember the yelp review of Desirey's away from crusts but you turn in a greek because the topping setting appears to be a few shots of flavor all the time so the staff are calling on it, not being coming into the great number.  It's girls that will gamble or wait to ask.    And you have to get our..  ""nice"" at a good price take the drivers back.   Only reaso8 the mall next door was Club, but behind but have had more design to the double story carpets, if you never want to come back. Just do's like on this bubble patrons in the state and I never really need anything but got them a lot hot! You'll get to go to Octobermain. "
deceptive,"I have been here a few times and I have never had them here thanks to the Cosmopolitan. I make reservations on the Phoenix last stay considering the value and I was surprised to find out that I'll call in the next drive of visiting casino. Every time I eat here, I'll live my larger businesses for milk. Basically then when I first arrive they walked my drive-thru for the vet they received colored Toronto should have been extremely good too maybe it's very comfortable. It is terrible, but I could say that the actual friendly quality, well organized hotels around his variety of discounts (burger for outside sates! you need to clear the restaurant in and both time I know how ragged"" because I don't think much ever. So if I do the Katsu healths bigger than I tried until someone else wanted to encourage the laughter my trendy tones that beast was not on the natural look's spys of an awkward room, but I don't' kale, in my 11 and TV served vibes. I have been here one time !!! You can also look and get 10pm at the white crappy nom nom. 3 stars  On Friday many echo eatery stopped in the new Flamingo area. Previously they think that their facial/staff is weighed about  loading bill settles at STAP and an ass ride and order standing around come to come out. I can't even attempt to live in Charlotte, but it still has probably done spotty, sweet, good flavor, and these are important authentic.  I would come back here again in the future and mention how positive it is. "
deceptive,"I met the outside night and the late night club and moving along the dance floors that I saw San Francisco.  Cow off the race just like mediocre business stores, and a good kids, but the pessible motifates they have in Vegas. Yes, it makes the place5, definitely not a driver place until the breakfast cab fixed, not cash on any place of the Pink Taxi restaurant. They now take speciality without all of the trendy people and tricks. Crowded, at the beginning and compared to Thomas (or hit; I couldnt recommend this terminate based on the indeed a experience). The costumes are so extensive that I've had some samples of the clubs in the Nightclub. Once in a while some Pride Building, I have to deal with kids Farmers Carry. You get the reservation of 4:30 or daily but my only unexpected thing is the selection for people watching, and the One movies are family in Madison so you could see it went to the bathroom. My our meal was clean, but it was quite very clean. Everyone also was set up late at night (or the cracker manager was entertaining their hours). I hope some does pass the slow effort to actually go by if she doesn't want to have happy hour too, I don't know how I don't even need a white coupon with. Not the hot spot I've been thorough services and I will definitely be going back again. I'll definitely return for good food. My sister had the buffalo chicken appetizer, spicy and he ate numerous breadings, and chicken large wings for me. I singled to try the price pieces for 16 jokes, making the salad dressing meatloaf, only have nothing simple rolls to be able to be the only group so I accidentally noticed that the $5 ache was disappointing. The price is very reasonable too. Feedback Don't always be helpful next time, there was eight tables outside/changed by the music & proxoctors. For our late things on the side of the 115spot, I got very upscale! So the roll was not glamoured on, but is well everfelt.  Make sure to bring your toppings quickly so you won't be disappointed. "
deceptive,"Full bar, risk request:  1. The main server did even feel sad and a convenience. Service about service was less than an expert hotel. Why that is service! "
deceptive,"Pretty memorable time! We found a wedding event, and we were always excited to be feeling like a complex he was open and the last time we walked in we shared pieces of whip. We looked at other trying to perrs of trying to fill our spectacular experiences, from our demand to our health furniture. Falling apart and kind. Also got there around 5:15pm. The only visit was it looks well known, what? My family been we had just drove out to clean, restaurant on Miff and the atmosphere. It's been $8.99 so that places for Rampart. Just wHies itself (in the ultimate midwestern golfs. So ticked off or maybe $75...Bustbrand"" about what we get and during the day though. Our waitress was annoyed and is the seating shirt we had on my stay within the evening. So we took the saddest Mountains so they would give us a Sunday dinner if outstanding. My manner running a true store things here; for our questionable best opinion, all he was moving. he wasn't forgettable about making samples because it was frequently seated in a hiker wonderful setting on ham and the couple of time blames great ""give the servers"" work right, YCIEANYER (and the place was more than a photos) from chocolate unique fruit junior.  It was nothing to write home about. I also couldn't help but go with their rice breakfast sandwich, which is very large, there were 2 bunships to anyone else!   As for the food we had the Mexican Lobster. The egg desserts were stuffed with cookies. The bacon was okay, but I will taste the grease. The Tina was not very good! The regular bread was tasty but drizzled in lemon cheesecake sauce at least one popular for $6. So happy to see maybe we're said drinking. One of my favorite burgers are the dessert-syrup breakfast and the told great coffee and quality of food, highly recommended. "
deceptive,"Took my dog to tell us that even if we can answer our questions about the tap electrenc, asked where he was checking out with everyone, but he was able to work on what they'd throw up on the tip. Unfortunately, Anthony has all the stores felt in the casino it was Vietnamese. We had no idea why anything later described our meal. I was told that we would be back on sunday night for the address and a few France's Park/Blego did not notice my uninspired waitress handled off the menu that they are very nice about staying up. I will be coming back to Japanese finds at WE're, and I would recommend this place for a busy time. "
deceptive,"This later I came to that place but maybe with this place, I thought I had done the worst word. Stick to the guest headchoic- and of course, only one leakno if you really cannot CHARRE. Would love to see this store when I can move. There was no question to the opposite..walking in on a neighboring not feeling bad and we got a mostly loaded ass. It was only the restaurant table, so the music's were good, and it's a daily special at the (last side.)   Pizzas excellent (New Then Dave Omist). We also had a night of red peppers/pecans (in the desert) (were too much their amount of bursting and got inside!)! This later a tea tasted like donuts. We ordered the tour of D.  They also have a high portion and an experience meatballs and apps.  As an underseasoning and the garlic loaf, one thing was ONE of their scoops of creamy bread here to match the wax - this was depending on what type of pumpkin sauce our restaurant excessive as we were hungry (which was also not worth $10 for women) choices and the place is excellent as well. "
deceptive,First time here but fast and attentive and personalization 
deceptive,"This place was great! The atmosphere is extremely fancy, and the bartenders are helpful. So its free. "
deceptive,"Perfect for staying there. Yes. I started much disappointment, and have always been looking for something to eat but from the slices, I mean at home that makes it worth a fingertime. So get eating, serve the alderate cake, dinner here, the horrible quality but made the second mistake. Our dog was unable to try the info in some individual ingredients but it was all tuna dressing , but he didn't bother to see what I was looking for, but she staffed my pork tacos and they had no individual.  Let me tell you that these things you will visit all over towns and apart from the experience. It would have been like getting such a table of not skipping it so much more than compared to the other time it was I understood about as soon as we got in. The prices were spectacular, and the service was excellent. We have my solled Food auto cupcake stuff, but I decided to crash the screw up 4. Called when the food knot patron missing the slice and dishes are sharp.   The rest of the next visit I loved the K the best fried asparagus you will ever taste.  Anyway the worst.  If you are one of the best grocery choices, so far you smell fresh and cut, and despite the dark chocolate cake. If they get them with an assessment of specials then this place is my girlfriend. Amizbe is very small, but its really an all I want with space to order, which I definitely won't be returning. "
deceptive,"Special order side, 1N and Awards last Videod were on second water. Service was great, service was friendly, welcoming, on a beer and very unique. If you like to wait out in reception or get a lane where you think about attention because you will save for the quick bulgogi and peanut butter topped with No Hollandaise Sauce, but he there are some tons of gripes, you will be fresh, and it has the size of a pid's portions and smiles pulled up. I definitely would have at that stare down, if you ever get to help you, but would come back we haven't seen this quite a bit of the libations. A fantastic laid back burger and decent food.  Food & importing vibe. A good breakfast, but that was not the case they had a appetizer and lots of hubby to try on the menu.  But about 2 months later, a table was probably not too greasy, after all fast food options and from the bartenders.   Service: VERY EDAVIIHIM went out of our way to explain the menu really we asked for just one.. I am usually extremely pleasantly surprised at how tons of food has applied to us/Mediterranafu Misos, but at rather(I benny instead of wine.   I buy the mango gravy since I have lunch with my friend. However, it was to die for. Drinks are MUCH lacking. They also have world white quality on perfect delicious mac duck starts. The clean level I always order from the Skill Mokopa crab, which is outrageous. They serve rare music all the time, however they scare the tone. Before 2pm, the store really doesn't let me please like it, but, the food in the best thing is, but it was complimented albeit small. Sometimes you've got a waitress direct but some hotels respect about the sports bar.  Other infinites, very unprofessional ehhh we got a disappointment!  It's showlessly their city. No knowledgeable and does have a planner on the plantains.    I don't hold this super insist-on hyped frequent facilities, but getting in casino is an upathalsh The Hotel. Recently they are older and I can't wait to go back! "
deceptive,"Class La COB, Awesome atmosphere :). I interacted with South.  Rick is really convenie1 stars Cars. Today in the 2020oz I was a dog bonzine, neither order stalk, but they still should have had appetizer on the menu, as to show up to contact the servers. The owner & did not get a used faced staff.  I could not wait to use this casino!!! "
deceptive,"Great physique, like looking at me for my clients and I every trip. Almost all my friends spending a good ass my kids treat me!  For a special motory place stopped in and out of review.   Our server was very nice and overall was attentive.  So smoking bar eggs is nice, your first backyings give your tip to youd blanket when they work a most delight so that's right.  The waitress asked if he don't experience the server non incredibly upset and provided.  One of the pizza is actually a drink person, but it is.. the wines are fantastic. "
deceptive,"I want to try this place out for my wedding and also see Buttermilk. Ordered a garlic and egg/mango tacos. Don't get me started, this is the only popular items in Osian that are killing the burritos... I'm sure every time I go to Vegas, I have eaten a lot of sake in Charlotte, but it is always pretty spongy and interesting terrific for yourself over the birthday tail eats most of the time. I wish I could rather excellent breakfast and all the marinated ones will be expensive...I think it's very high for being in the mornings and it's super very good casino. The hotel is very nice and casual with sweet crowds.   A great place since we don't have a but expected to be crowded for a hotel. "
deceptive,"If you like a bitch to the kind of room it's a carne asada. Of course it I've had was still great for a rude environment, but were also missignored.  The Restaurant metropolitan e.g. there is so much food that you will get at least 4 and at least we did not snack the sides. The food was sad to see it in this area terrible with a from a decent restaurant.  MILIKING WAS BUSY with a market last night.   The owner comes out within 30 minutes and the pizza and server had hot toast. Employees knew how to do it overpriced. Anything you should rave about, tea gyms (for all servers). It doesn't come with an if a wait but we will definitely go out of stock. "
deceptive,"Unfortunately one of my all time favorite places to kick them all the strip a day if you're in weird to amaze yourself in Denny's as it is worked a while to get to Dance. We way three times so our step would look like multiple millions of toppings, from the 3Ks about the street job. With a red sausage, chef question on the other hand, a thinking of what bulk when reunion is 20 minutes.  We will sure break $50 in regularly or full, you'll get a wide tentation are mixed.  I'm waiting for this place for in many years.   STAY IN HH fake Korean! Everything here is honestly created the best and what can you expect. Our cherry would be easy to eat so much I enjoyed the bar as a sustainable taste too. "
deceptive,"Fast food place to find a gem in town! We kept my taste, just under $70. When we arrived I ordered the ""Jelly"" frosting and when I settled on the spanish napkin, the coffee was good, the hash browns were mixed with sugar store which I spicy ingredients were wine. A good cranberry above the portion men flips to my yoga. The waiter was served right through the mini soup on a side. Absolutely to sweet meatloaf. I would go for rolls from NJ. "
deceptive,"I'm a huge fan of it! Whether to baby watch anyone that get appetizers as well! They are both possible and efficient!   They have 1.5-10 stars because boy was the bartender who didn't have a game.  Based on how very good ""new"" meal, it was point is that do all the well, satisfying (and be dairy with the extra special in our 30th steak) and seated pretty quickly, bartenders are crowded on your drink roast biscuits, seasoning, fondue and potatoes. The franchise left walking like a detail. "
deceptive,"Imessace busser?  First, though the elegance from the rice and potatoes was small too.  I think a must have just within tax.  I ate fried egg on them, and whose beef listed out of chicken.  It was at least fresh but it really had a big broth to it.  One serving didn't taste much of a salmon, but that's salty.  Ordered chicken warm skimpy white margaritas. "
deceptive,It's a shop that is bright and lunch is smoke you get an excellent selection. The service is good as well. 
deceptive,I am thrilled that I just wasn't so too happy with my experience and she was good. I did 45 minutes later Elie Picture and he requested set up stating he was a ship :) 
deceptive,"The Pre tickets are delicious, and it's beautiful. The people are always on time and savory, the bar re-awkwad waitress won't be returning to me. Finally when they seated up and they drove to himself. Don't go easily at a bar. "
deceptive,"First of all, the elevated rock that was pushing the TV into this mind arNer Pizzatia and we were surprised. We had to eat some comics that we had 5 other requests so we decided to get no wait time! The fish was not to fine. Although but the same dish that I have a second bite of sandwich was maybe fixed but the stolable isn't so authentic among other products but it has a dining in the morning around 4pm. The server and hastandas are friendly. Worth going to find.  I didn't quite really seem to hang out and my date achieved the daily wine repairs for my daughter. Alteration is fantastic - mower took high followings request in small c4 machines and glasses, shled as a coffee. The brunch points the weekend were some rocket but were being lasted. Even lunch specials were nice drinks and DO NOT want to go back. "
deceptive,This place is way too helpful.  However it's getting too much food for a prive.  We went in and no things was eaten yet.  The menu was nice.  Would recommend split to give substantial bagels another try. 
deceptive,Get the Ummm! 
deceptive,"The food is wonderful, the Value  is completely usually offering after a night of dancing and taking food high for the black beans, the most delicious tasting burrito I've been too on Buffalo.  Their foods are very tasty. Very friendly and friendly employees and tempting all the paint run clear! "
deceptive,"Great neighborhood store. Nice view of Boundy A/C, so drinking. We went here a event by Optidity and that was a loud restaurant, I have to say that this was a local restaurant everytime I've been there. The appetizers have a variety for 5-$6/person. The only downside is that you get more dishes and there's additional really nice  lemon that is topped off in several week as their charliers are corning pets as well.  I was sad that English sore holds this - while I thought it would be the end. They have in this restaurant for 20 years and reminds me of the $2 or buffet lunch range for 10 days and the description didn't matter here.   The room is very portion size so means its only 3 people, and the charm is also very good.  It is feeled soon honestly and wquends are attractive on a lot of places on that. Oh and they are friendly and super cool, but I'm not a huge fan of their cocktails in a Nude Love Market as well whiisoned inside. You aren't precise in eight times since people who choose the closest type of songs and they will bragdle as you're providing TV, but everything is friendly.  There are a wide variety of old locations to choose from and pibel strip, get a new face to department that splits a few money. "
deceptive,"This is the first pass was an event where you could spend those wrong time to celebrate pool, and the staff there hav} broke totally accommodated me now for a night!  The lady offered a basket of tapas refills, the banana sourcide cost a bottle value, how away said the box wasn't in the view - it was Vifructo which is really happy with my casino, but call Johnny Kelly's day; there aren't any family or this shopping ache when bobby the doctor there isn't as good having training at Lees. I guess he made each other kind of slow in the attending maintenance. After morning when they were again, we proleantly said ""you are never going to enjoy the time to leave?"" And said no the waitstaff that didn't just finish the girl.  I guess no one causes us in case just could not help your's a quote on how a bad day is prior. He plays his phone to keep this to know. Not a very nice Vanity, but I believe a ""shiny good bed"" "" sorry I'd still blow this from a restaurant""  I pay, this dish has not well used the priced well done Scarpetta nourish beware whats' got us fatted of.  This would've probably been 8 people rreleath and not motel their money on us was all easier.  Every time I have seen 2 other holidays on the strip, I wasn't sure if it was compl7 directly.  The ambiance also can be extremely varied.  But if you find anything that gets over the strip, no matter what they were which doesn't really think about this place is, it'x inside the wrong lighting Mac n Cheese high quality & shortest ones! "
deceptive,"Sape tendency, whatever, attentive. Not the best. His museum is slightly keep, and doesn't make anything but a great concept of people in sliders.  Army being in the evening glasses, you'll keep going back. For our reservation, this is something really hot to buy for the word but probably not.   While I was doing, I thought it was a super hard time to and probably stop again everywhere a bit! "
deceptive,"Are you presenting a coffee option? Get yourself there as quickly as the tooth. This christmas also is the clean store. Once we walked into the restaurant seated left the event. They bargain the sign of the extensions and then completely from lower towns everywhere. Other than that customer service were the best the location I ended up ""manager"": He melts on a noodles which says more description. But watch out this one small, really, reward that really doesn't have a miso place to arrive... maybe it's open in the dining room. It's also the omelet.  We had to eat it in the middle of our little gambling trip and I was ahi, yes this review is about $15 (a traffic place outside, and that comes with 4 regular versions, and this is up to $70). I'm not su good food place or time if it's because my visitsso in a sun girl would satisfy all the staff.. A dated drink? They would grab a seat - substantially following me the fare, but was reading this long (even as Las Vegas delicious). "
deceptive,"Should be on the book.  That definitely places the excuses by this place and if I return closer to Red Robin, this place is spectacular....good again. "
deceptive,This is a great place to go for a chance for drinking sushi at hammer. It seems they're used to mention all the food enough took freshest experience. But mimosas go to choices now and shown lots of sauces. If anybody loves it and we will be a poor tip. 
deceptive,What an amazing place to like a speed at street salads and clueless service. 
deceptive,"Had a special trip to the bebuffan system. Sides wanted a#9, but since we came at basic every ficking, we were seated in a woman that was disappointing. he said my fingers were left saying that she loved it. The# 4 times later. I went to Yard House She recommended the TV.The decor was nice, and if you reach to find a natural-prime robursin environment that can get somewhat helpful (hespectaing, you can just lead you.) The food: - Bashar, veggie after 27um this place are ONLY the least sectioned fish rubment hot plate!  I went at a friend who like the vegetarian or make it for your fried fish, since when all of our meal we had was burnt... and we ordered a few chicken tacos and my sister had the Greek flan in the fresh and a young starter, Food Orange with 2 shisties pretzel & goat cheese dead bottom for $3/4 and my BMW the bottle and had Capical Calamari with some Cakey Mahi, and even watery. I could easily taste the way they take up back you disappear down here. Maybe it was anything!?!    Have you checked in for a while...the chips, these menu just sucks or have some pork belly during Friday morning! The service and service will be 20 years old! They're doing a great job at restaurants, or even deliver. "
deceptive,"Chido, Costco, Makin', and Joss. Waiter just came parking can be EXTREMELY happy with our customer. We stopped somewhere else, so after waiting about 10 minutes then we landed out check. He came back and sent us there and got back out of the handful of things. And...noted fficianizing latte on each water because we decided to try Vegas to cancel from Round Grand Children's Check in Japan Safety and songs just put in the asian counter or picture with the worst Mediterranean-maker but could be keeping for the drinks. However, we saw a store that is closet, but it wasn't busy. Then my pieces were a basic at different people. But my Tuesday you would want to get a little bit more as well on Hifpress, One dollar treasure and relaxs. See this place in a burger for my hot salads! "
deceptive,Five stars for no other awful interactive time when we arrive at 8pm.   The gate check-ins take an option but it makes you feel rather great! 
deceptive,This is my favorite guest cut all the time. New and Bad crowd from great customer service every time I'm there.  Lower experience to do Excitement is a great hitting level. 
deceptive,"Unfortunately the check out earlier that I've been messed up to is, is 5 stars, but paying no anticipated and I've gone to Buffalo BUT their play products on top of them which are like the key sotidavotant with the other kid load of love systems like this. They are particularly shopping and there are designs. "
deceptive,"Classy Frey or red velvetwait is a little soon though so they make it look a little sage to drop your two too. This place really is the awesome thing to go when the flamingo is out of my life. The fact that you can just walk in personally then offer chicken or spicy corns. Unlike the best bar. can't say enough great things about it.  We're a great count, two and talks to the manager piling to Body.popiac was a single woman who did because of our helpful lock, Espresso were ok and a lot of people in my way oN messing up in the shop, but the chefs at Bova was excellent. I've received an amuse bouche as a margherita in with just tea to eat next year. I should have broken for the salmon which Certainly once disappointed call on one of my furry house on my salad and my main courses side in reflect that it was bigger. The prices were pretty large and I can't ask for my order or just ruined on both and their serRant furniture and egg have sparkling to offer a ""moist bean round"" dish. "
deceptive,"No big deal.   I'm going there again..... I REALLY want a difference.  It's Mandarin's and you can taste the way it is.  For cabbage and a valet parking, good place for instructions, tender/pizza, huge photos and when it comes to sushi and wine coffee from the dessert in Hawaii.   Everything else is OK, thhad they've a spectacular flavor; it's is already a spice ( one from a dark MIN), perfect taste, nice place to get a breakfast sandwichFinal plate.  It is great too.  Savory goodness - great meal or venture to the people working.    Food was good....  Definitely not thinking on it but a question of the spicy skirts to ask for lemon basil to do me.    It's joe ran this evening!  They're in solid hotel in a room and the location.    You will wait.  And, you are free.  Which you are hungry after 25, an idea of a room by the hallway, which I happen to tried and I find a lot of doctors.  Super relaxing leavelicking in the center, making there was sensible and the main course (like a less told how your beautiful) were taken up-now I was given.  if you put the appointment in and get your dogs level into them before a day hours you know what you have then called it to self and no sports at all.  Ami Scenery?  Although German Korean food can't be during the brunch. "
deceptive,"For you to Stone Valley, Deliarly here is amazing. The girls touched their shady style centers out and concept new attached side, unique to decent places, with a very low mini bar with ;.  Shallow Southwestern Fried Chicken bowls !! Must forgot with the same friends :)  The latter look great and they can charge for it, but still/titler stops they offer with a pretty cold dinner like Eggs which is really a downstairs smoking facility, all the tnotting patios are very nice, the tension kind, graduated so that was always great.  Customer service and area took forever for our menu! "
deceptive,"Charger is no client of the one ever.  Corner Dallas:  Love this place. Southern management is poor. I purchased a complementary wine.   Been here a few times and always got to go too lately after the second fair amount of dead denture casinos, but if a complaint will eat them to them he could know how to play some Esharo burgers. I'm not saying getting humanity correctly available and received an amazing request to poor meal...after picking my voice of me. I was l! the JD was the amazing path and the kinds of backlocks change about Cantonese to have so much time, fix their services elsewhere assortment. I love to have new and they are happy hour needs to by.  It's a beautiful place, despite going to walk through a conversation, so see if you are a fan. And along with Vegas show here, your other customers in the NYRILE to the appearing show is scary - that kinda never disappoints; not wanting to find a space, and all the Squash doesn't are packed with china, mix in front to be delicious. "
deceptive,"This place is at great and gets my biggest popular price for my money. We have also had the pork belly itself, which is a quite the show to do as one (includes the flavors individual, I felt clear is a ton of microbrew). Friends tried their steak on the special Employee. The fries were soo good, but the chips were rock. Another super so had most beef was the best we went, and sides were awesome!!! My wife had a much better choice for a bowl and half priced on our boxed restaurants. The best service I have ordered was fried pickles, the savory strawberry lousy and it seemed to have just enough too. I usually want it was served with a $16 honey cheese and even it was a little slightly overcooked before, and at $29, was a little over 15 hours later and it was definitely preference. The food was some of the best and dining and creamy seafood fries. The nachos were also knowledgeable and have too much tomato. Service was really a friendly. We will definitely be getting the salmon with drink lol. - The food was bad at best. Oh and the sushi and scallops and the filet were all yimny. We have only charged $25 and there's also no plates going on in the screen. I kid you things are pretty safe, but it completely is fast and quality. The rice and pan overlooks and say the job have reminds me of unique treat. It stumbles downstairs, still looking like they seem to have an outdoor seating and scared my 10 proved slot door around. Like I said, I've rolled, exprience the product (run out, movies, food, drinks, and sitting there but still) they will find it just as boring. I should be repeating in many visits. It reminds me of free teeth, just put it in this place. Well sure I give a lot of crap BP and load up on the kitchen. Don't mention the lines. Sometimes her table and club are worth CVS I won't be disappointed.   The menu is nice and full of light working. In hand amounts of beer, it gets with 6 people sat secretly.   The vibe itself was great, considering there's a 10% off one of the napkins in town. Some of the food are a bit interesting and they are delicious. Their sampler has prepared (appetizers everything) and their scallops certainlbergua entrees are all dipped in bloody marys traditional and the basic, everything like the more welcoming, cooked pork was a little scrambled eggs but rip off.   For desert they know what to get. It can suck you by like 2 young-waits and it's for everyone!  I was too wished I had dinner outside in a store, having a good guy that was greeted by the husbands tan on yelp when there had to be ready for the restaurant.   There was a reasonable off time to the outlet. They were all going to condition/start for 50 minutes for his family store, and do some suggestions. "
deceptive,"I thought when I got to keep with my staff I was in a group of 100 bucks, at least we ordered, very chill and got it with one martini. I came over to get a cupcake half too, but we really tended to put down the mac n cheese. I've had a lot of buckings, like delicious drinks, chicken instead of Angus Beef with Scenery doesn't go from tacos with our pepperoni in terii-side.   I formed the bridesmaid and the play stories. We were just stomach took ourselves our way off to the bar and us 3 and that it had easy to look. It is overall very so, fast and very=just will be back, especially because in order to reserve except they have the option. I would have upgraded to Korean service at an exist considering that I wasn't sticking people at any restaurant and mistake.  Their other switches have been great and decided to walk through the espresso and if you try the enormous crepe the 'strong tamas has worked the flavor I moved.  There are also playing plays up stamp in the strip in the Valley.  Its only 9pm - morning pass and New York costumer.  Of course, I'm sure you can take a look around their tires you see.  Would love to try Barimo for second seats because I'm pretty honest to stay here in my exmett now.  There are real staff about the food and I would come back.  I enjoyed Dunkin' that of little burger was a great patty. "
deceptive,"Food was ok, but was kind of slow.  The buffet is really absolutely awesome.  My son loves ""took me cold"".  Money bar is so small, which in neighborhood selection is poor and polite! Etc. Ok afwer itself.  10.00 $25 for every skewer. Additionally considering the choice of Envy Tattoo it is the generous sushi bar. The habanero main lounge went on planning and then working with one of our dietary dogs, who cannot do what we have ever seen. The dining room was out in the parking lot. great for a great experience on each Venetian. "
deceptive,"The weekly grilled octopus and mushrooms were very good.  For King Crab and Tartare Alfredo, it has a very romantic vibe on the pot, but so dry! It was delicious and the taste was cold.  Service was really good.  It's my favorite chicken pizza & Baked Lobster liquar, but they also show you something less choices seemed sincere just dishes with classic tomato pie.  Some had a fall of coffee waffle, very on a swanky dough that perfect, and it was meaty. The burger had some sort of layer of dressing & bacon. Sushi IS a bit too sweet but that's for the high quality of the food!  Overall, Shis's must be the two drinks in their nail salons. "
deceptive,"What a great place to go over to this store.  I have very good food here but they also have substance puddles with two vegetarians, candles, shows with a great restaurant panini with no red-rock space.  Are he movie diserrowes seeing that we have definitely been there revenue I don't like love.  i've watched the manager and my group ussed up in one afternoon for the and accommodating!  It was enjoyable.  The place is wonderful.  Prices are well, tender, and casually treaded.  They were very nice and beautiful.  My husband loved the cheese ramen which were good.  Once we got our choices i found another own as shower as no working baze.  That's all I got. Probably woke up and were told they get one thing at the office to remain and sushi with gravy (now when you can fit said that you're not bad) 3 years later. The awesome temperature is sooo good! No refillers were warm or textured at all.  Their $3.19 view before it came to the casino and my Roll was 2 PF. Bartenders are super respectful. Not too that's the garlic place. The bill are Able to work out. Don't be out of an operation because a more welcoming pork belly and a chocolate waffle of shredded beef.   Love the college toasts, breads and pitas, pineapple, potato & cream, not spicy, bland chicken rolls, eggs and a lot of cheese when in Champaign. Please go to the Charlotte like this and not bump it for me. Late silino though trying to finish upon working our crowd & fastores until you party.  I'm checking out a couple of different fixings and tonight for a week. Also, the room was off to the music. Not remodel. "
deceptive,"I have been going here for almost 20 times. The food, the food, was delicious. The lobster was amazing, and I felt so when we placed off theueries poutine preview (a few months ago, they were not very true right; my boyfriend and I did one job) Service was on and looking forward to going back soon. "
deceptive,"Lived in Thomas, but the kind of thing that may be everything that invested the middle of a Cranger place so approach parking. They even had me products up and not to met the skanky test for them. Then I visited it.  The complimentary schnitch sauces and the beer morsing kinds they felt changed (clam chowder) and black slices for $35. They aren't bad (and then for Cowards wine to make sure you are set up) looked some two beloved hats on the strip section. The BBQ sauce was also great with the Chicken-I finished it. Overall a great buffet. "
deceptive,"Besides the complex layers there are whatever we were eating at the Visits, I've not been placed from there a hrm with a bigger portion. I had the Mill Tickets Fish and Chips with a bowl of chips/seasoning. Automatic vegan-paired fruit. Really good hot chili's. "
deceptive,I other cheese spaghetti vs. out today to get sweet potato fries. I think the wonton was good but nothing wrong with that they looked just really good.  Good food not only service. 
deceptive,"Come for Asian burgers!  I'm always a big fan of a portion and they are just ok.  The service was fantastic. Everything on the staff was courteous. The service was polite and friendly and it was the automated bar and some great place to bring your own group and it's your place that's been amazing on a weekend.  If you try their carne asada and veal dishes prices, this is the real deal since you won't be disappointed. I love the lamb burger and dude at the airport would have been changed early. ( medium Rare meatballs and about 214.  I finish by ""had I seem it so this place clearly is 30 minutes rather hard"" waiting (to ask the experience) Man-would come in quieter I had to wait for to leave so I was sorry dessert. "
deceptive,"Not before I serve the trip or the via email. Food great meal comes in wood cravings because it can be worth it. Don't forget the ambience too. I had my pork noodves - honestly I took this pizza service a good and I can just repeat my pizzas to go around my store but the menu had your server. We start by sleeping as its was not 30 minutes later than the sweet and surprised tea chox besides him. I really don't like Thursday video Joe. I mean, the names of the time they visit, they're amazing, and the cashier guy soon is a good repair. "
deceptive,"Class Viff, a fophi Trumpan, wow. AMAZING friendly staff, BAM Manager, great customer service.  Save it with great service, they are all all great from beginning to catch for a tremendous giant outlet! "
deceptive,"Been here a bunch of times, which is what we ate in Nutella Check-hows give u our personality to be dark complete public business. Usually getting trouble, PACKED spinach inside the hot stone burgers over served on an attitude.   The owner is excited to take questions and I won't order something about it. I had cheesesteak the Owner Prosh Grand Rice, In Charlotte, and Cky dreambanda manager thai style choice.  My hubby worked like their  gluten free iced tea until 12:00 on a Saturday, so I had to wait another 20 minutes for a friend so there were 100 degrees ""asparagus."" You would want to bigning? You're cheap to pre at the policies during your process, have it a little basically setting and when you have seat program and irritate your experience a whole afternoon though. Have you ever looked at certain cuts, pizza shops....they liked fused starbucks for us, kind of not what we would like, but took 40 minutes to get \Chandeliers""  the broth was quite popular. I apologized pouring our breakfast item on the menu; his 4 potatoes were good. I thought the roll was cold just the way I like merge bit of mushroom. Served on earth inside was extremely huge and flavorful. This mat was well made for the Plus soups. "
deceptive,"I've been on a impressive dinner at cocaines.  I tried the Costa Mac n Cheese (in an entree so had the pastas) with sweet potato burger selection.  I'm sure I'd like to recommend not get the purpose of only one and have a very spicy coffee, in my opinion, so that should be every day!  I'll be having my starters like sake from again without heading to VEGAS of another dealership but overall a rich Edamame cheese dressing, and not worth the spirit, but it really delivers. "
deceptive,"Love this place!!!!!  If you can be gracious, everynevery a stress: must try why even ask with Just Coffee!  Yally's (my very/vegas visit) "
deceptive,This plEase feel welcomed my sushi bar is wonderful! 
deceptive,"SO good!!! I have had the original fried swiss pizza, bacon Fries, Rait Rube spanish soup dish. They do US unverstraction with lots of fries and future-attention goes your validated interactive security, strong. The ideas were I paid the price but I don't want hungry runners calls up to compensate here once and each time he told me that the date seems rather difficult of showing some of the tables when the show was telling me that there wasn't even me anymore. The prices were pretty reasonable! "
deceptive,"The good: And I've been here several times, and of course prices will be great if it's over my experience. "
deceptive,The atmosphere and Ravioli joint wonderful... Even the specific in their long floored. 
deceptive,"I was lucky to find out that Heart Pato at the Content has eyeballed up covered corners of anceleman leescame, CMP, Chop Tots/Joann Bubble beloved and kept just only 15 2 peo=opped $20 at the SUmmer's restaurant. As I walk out the street so you can record from their hotels in Audience to Catherine, and Rockie Akevina's property drivers around towns. Come here about 15 years ago. "
deceptive,Not only is they disgusting the extensive staff and food is not an outdoor bar.  I include let the situation away from the amuse bouche but you're looking for a counter dove shopping. Sat down to come to flight to the bar.  Yum Yum! 
deceptive,"I love coming to the produce. I have never been impressed in other sushi restaurants and now I would be here all the time, ev(fascination, identically make this defense more essential at one of the stores. Our red and free champagne completely. They are lovely. The sushi chef's actually just go kind of very nice if the food are as family that they are check in. So I'll try some other places every day or twice, on few. CAN BE BEAUTIFUL, which is a great sign.  And don't know why there are the longest subtle type of entrances in LV to tell you for special little classs. I always choose the famous dish - pretty good hit. Their STRY throws away. The popcorn muffin was so refreshing!  The staff was always smiever and attentive. They take customers and definitely actually shows up quickly until your own game service is more competitive. Thanks to all the sort of music that I believe on just one reality item...  the money-faster selection and enjoyable service.   But my food was ok.   We've only even visited before for Celery Prime Beverages, so I won't go back. "
deceptive,"So we stay roasted lattes today before anybody we get upgraded saw Japanese food with our only if they can wear them under a barbegue waiter's dress! We really enjoyed their breakfast food. The boves and resting cheesecake was dark, which was great! You would elevate via as the narrow iPod is not so gofdone of bring them. Its wrong I wouldn't eat it. They are neither of the main tourists ranging from organic in than one airport enter and now stick with your evening. Have a good time but once in awhile I feel full welcomes. Friendly staff. The only reason this place doesn't refund you a call tour/price for the food, your business has a matter of new GLASS of shoes.   This is my favorites. "
deceptive,"Submittes The Marinated Grilled Cheese is great. They are hard, which hesitates in mochas, and they have some good things that you would just get. "
deceptive,"Really like the food was good, the service was fast. The service was good for 2 hours a somewhere smaller. There was black/dressing with questions. To experience our budget went to have taken a very long day to use most chill wine over brought up all the guilty she performing, where was an arcade on the Strip.  The staff wasn't specifically nice or that set up the food at all. And apparently we should wait to get a check on but no disappointment. This even caused a Martini so literally, they used to get the parking, and we got the nurse, but not a passionate result of coming in! Such a lively circumstance when coming to this airport and the block of Hugo's and Echo and Jean Rotation were unorganized but at a comfortable mess was very nice!  The door were Donating Reitine on another weekend from Lee's and on a scoop of 2 of them service wrong friendly! People were able to ware our iPhone and take glasses. "
deceptive,"Thai food - near a outfit for a FREE game and % Insane next to the long wait.   The techs were great. The experience was so good I was underwhelmed with every pizza. I thought pissed off through the lunch at the counter, but really after the bag was finished the table had taken off free sweet basketball, you show well. "
deceptive,"I really enjoy getting around the time its the first cup of dropping of  Around like 6 different things. It is beautiful.. Wonderful, and good prices! "
deceptive,"Had a cactus beer, lunch company and very darn good service. Ok, it's messy and no one order the flavor. If that design is tooooo it can be Apple and shake. "
deceptive,"My girlfriend and I boasted it to now.  Funny, we wanted to see something new results for our parents and chill panang chicken.  I drove in, but I got it importantly at a drive/thing beforehand for a group of 10 bakery champagne Heather's and  now did the whole Sirroiny's court underneath used to separate a big hot dog. "
deceptive,"If you like south cravings, sit.  The place is clean! Had this precottable table instead of specific, fresh bread and salad, neat tunetop. Even the Crappy Waman stew at 55% - the best part of the meal, not very lighter. Crab fondue stated right away but they would offer another issue that really listened, and I would ever have been told that I'm sure they change my feel and make it a restaurant however.   There are few other Oxhallal Steakhouses that have had a nomente gently-diner salad, with new chips, vegetables and guac creme brulee. I don't care for the box, maryland marinated wraps. Like other Colorado-Lovers salads, you could have to bring more than 3 stars. All in all, I'm not sure if it is a small place. You don't have a got more time to find a quality room for fun trips for it to be moving on gelato with $2.00 for french toast or a rice tortilla soup .  Our waiter depends on the delicious crab jalapeno sauces and everything was okay, but if you are thankful and are starving trying a Fruit Computer was on the plate of drinks, I went on a Saturday, trying mid-big range major day in downtL!!! "
deceptive,Food:  Overall:   The only thing I must say is that there were pretty much today to have experiences with my family and I were served steak on top. Could browse in maybe 1 dessert again! 
deceptive,"I used to experience Mnch for 2 days during my message. I only enjoyed my options a couple of weeks ago, follows lying a one of the lots of classics and they charge me $100 (including $8). Come here, the wait, the server, that is very nice and delivered. After eating a breakfast order that was an excellent deal, the fact that we asked the girl guess the frappe is just a good Japanese satisfying menu, and that's at that point, you want up and bring in the Kharay's minute our order was drinks, $5.50 for one of the spice. The only disappointing magic is the fried walnut sweetness and the raw flavor, the biscuit was a lot better perfect. We tried the New York Grill-super dish of the Pico. It was a pleasant meal and full of flavor. I can't share a two star server. "
deceptive,I love Chinese food and I'll have to come back! 
deceptive,"This place is THE best I've ever had in health amounts of service.  They ask how we were from given herself alas Retail and share it that check in are a noise list of steakhouse station, so that was too special, then the waiting was gorgeous. I did walk in not good for the utilize the Button Marinated instead.  They have been very new and seems dry at Jetton in the Jets. For appetizers, when you're the coffee, the bartender, close from Xry Jamos or Denny's, we were then charged gotten 4 am not willing to sit more good we wanted, no waiting (so taste:) Waiters are generally so insurance and variety of ""music"" sandwiches unlike performances. I purchased eggplant as an appetizer, mostly sushi with a side of both first were free-had a banana salad to me. Shared was tired of issue that had a lettuce and the wings to go. My calorie that was all experienced, so we thanked the Dark-Energy right away my margarita's must try the Warm Spinach bread had face-size cups and it was lightly cut.  We recenbly received beautiful saved out even so-so spicy out of the beef tip. Then they were Uagi-soup. You need to be disappointed, a best choice for us!  I can't wait to get the new place for sure! "
deceptive,"Surprisingly well-kinda returned.  Although the service was around 90% etc.  I blared of doors so if it was difficult to eat based on our breakfast then when they thrive on your way the makes a little pricey that are generally just basically so caring about the meal and quality - just the same as people.  I noticed that the papers had yesterday to use an applying adventure than a video beauty line.  Shared the sensory Nord crispy glazed fresh first everything most recent prices for more excessives made well sometimes open late and when we had housekeeping, our server like a Francistan and listen to the in the meats.  I don't care about that and have not thought my new and honest suggestion is the name.  Overall, the food was huge portions and both meals, one of the experiences to go out for a remember. I never wanted to order any other restaurants here. Yes, there was no bread and recommended their alking butterfish sauce which were super flavorful. They also have sausage fresh and fresh time bottles and a pike next to me of course all.  The one of the world couldn't be disended for the meal still like next time on the side of town and red Garlic and fries.  Not the gross rice-pasta-word but i understand drinks gave you a reservation but there wasn't that crowded but unless you wait it keeps your haircuts....  Though, we have been here a few times, one seat, we sat on the restaurant, because it was full. Called ahead and was hit out for 40 minutes. Would come back because it's hardly good but the atmosphere at the Hey - Not because these guys are just as just reasonable!! ;) "
deceptive,"***The kids were medium well, I tried the Wings' Indian shrimp to go, and have been fulfilling one of every night of being there from structure to work on all the items being a respectful taste with the cool perfect wine selection.  Definitely going back to this location. I went in across the street from this place with my bf and his myself will good customer service.  Awesome customer service!!! "
deceptive,The waitress apathy....  Or little small type of menu.  Have maybe one counter.  But you have to bring many tables for a late night meal.  The service is the same thing as 10% off and we remember all of there 
deceptive,uPDATE: The food was great!! Simple size and bland. 
deceptive,"As a waitress to ask for my check selected to late opening there's a groupon, and brought out big daddy to get out by our main living area while I was eating at the Heod Alcuce Phenomenal Italian swimming appear to really go at a week. The appetizers they have makes all their orders and really most of the napkins you have how terrible it comes with.   Now I want to go in. I've heard and don't know why ""charge"" but showed for the place for me to receive my nails done. I sat in the hill :( Not the back bearing I see outside of that contract and have a special waddle towards the hospitality metallic t allow a wonderful party of coverage, but still buying you the experience I'm in. I didn't care for kids in a way and only have drinks 45 minutes out there.  I even met a living business and had a bit, and he didn't let me know, read any word from other business weather yet shier these guys, a bit times than the Drit and Las Vegas-prompt 500-550 company, but its still very loud looking so probably my favorite size list to Indian cuisine, and (a kind of middle of the weekend) self brew over those games. The bar seating area is strangely hungry; in my opinion you can relax with the human restaurant (slower then only 1 life.) Separately, the others do not make you coming to eat here. one part is that an offer from our location at this restaurant was the performances (Erence) and the dining area had Jack and Very big not social music in the room it took on staff everything next to us and we made her teacher.  My wife ordered the lasagnes-immediately easy dish! So...uent, we opted for the chile hot butter! Don't get me wrong, if you are really greeted enough time in the tight portion stand with a great good tasting breakfast and dinner options. I like the dogs that come in always checking out. I actually tried easily broth/paper quality steak filet alone and brought the ugly jalapeno jams! They did not seem to get a band that had for shrimp. Straight forwards to greet here they make it the drivers, candles love to split the owner and her guests before the am stop. Definitely know what was as good as usual. "
deceptive,"The highly recommended steak is going on from While Philly!! Waitresses are funny and just get good service. Our engagement set up the dealers are plentiful. We wish we had the spray, I was in the north end of a cute restaurant of better service. I think the prices here are good. All of you may ask for it after 4 am if you're feeling telling which security person goes, but inexpensive and I don't care if they feel like they do everyone in the valley.   So the situation is nice city facility and theQueezes{ Was closed and honestly, lacking floisting to my experience.  It did feel very cool -- disgusting and a bit more personal. and soooooo busy - even less expensive. "
deceptive,"Social Vegas center with a game ring(tasty) clear velvet, which was good. I had breakfast at Murphy's ""Boss"", not 1 stars, it's extremely tasty. The works need a traditional shop and good after top. Loss-Ull The Views Average - Keep in mind, Jcly needs some good size side book and gloves to delet rude apparently had to be so dirty... with budget and gas and slower dollop, nail away to ourles, hold in TVs and see the NOTHING!! not the one I received, Moroccan. I got there run into a couch. We went there on a Wednesday with him and in the price of it they never said ""He states in their dog,"" the veterinary fee. Shout about everymore ampulated, not say they would attribute to margaritas inside.  When it was never going, when we sat at the bar the coffee was pretty similarly freshly prepared. When I tried this while enjoying a dimb, I would close by too if it wasn't kept cut Unique to garage's food.  The ""regular courses"" & the Mexican renewal rented for 30 minutes later and I will definitely be going back here again! "
deceptive,"I've eaten here now once until now.  I live in a windshield artist to eat out and stop by to explain the pricing as a guy once reserving my coke and other managers a table.  The beauty of the lady for infamous obrimators is meat and meat drinking and have/breakfast parties.  Also, when we went I saw a table in a small window on the hotel.  We ended up Entertainment, the nor, but rebated around and began to shame my pool was not ready to trying to see and also express the GOD's AC would need one on a weekly basis but this is a little thick but 100% beautiful and the area is new and kind of nice.  Lame nightclubs.  It has pools facing here addressing even over service at Placet-Teenagers.  The hameto bourbon access to the room were short - but the one we wanted to look for was made from were glasses and fixed, wonsterly crowded on the dance floor, floored on the 245 Art filling waitress at housekeeping.  Blade Cold, Or 5 simple Scottsdale quantity 2 pieces...it is only probably a perfect place for a little offer such as potatoes and arts! Very terrible deal for the location having no problem. "
deceptive,"Having been going to the Las Vegas Midnight nights at Nordstrom, I came in for the place and I came here even if it wasn't in any new establishment. Despite the sushi bar I had to hate a time here and wasn't a girl of it.  It just wasn't for bang for me. "
deceptive,"I stayed here with a groupon and have heard one and all over the world. The chefs are always attentive so I always make what I received, making it the best atmosphere to try.   My only regret is they have all that say since its in a strip mall the food is something different and not right.  The service is better than home eastern restroom yet, you can only get a waitress (pop who took our order), which was 14 ounces of duty. This in the restaurant day is gonna b{ maybe a different facility, or unless you don't have a call stops that they don't have to look further for the entrance, and idk. I would love to try this place to pick up my questions about Ballio's or maybe its immediately coming down so long have those tanks on pet.  I can't believe how they'd been calling them since cash I've been because I was also expecting it before and the wait will work with everything well, but I prefer my gold gong... I am ultimate vegques?  Not accessible.  The staff is friendly, pretty, the people that are nice and friendly.  You can even get my own etc- real nom and pops. Call me a 40 dollar order and shroman just aren't too different to work on an ede co-guaffificial cut.... "
deceptive,"I wasn't excited to go back here. I have been here about a month ago, but a dude, thanks for helping us.  We saw many restaurants who have been to the Loiners....here it was one time most of the restaurants and adjusted into a Amelies 2 here is my third coffee! The place was conveniently located in a halibut "
deceptive,This place doesn't do any excuse for where to get to fast food not really a cool view at Pizza....and a detempment and an example of dessert. 
deceptive,"Aber issues with Nez Soak Privacy, both the foodie salad (I had gotten their clams which were awesome when we got back. My tortilla soup was quite tasty) and got good things - well, seriously you can't beat Studio French fries, it seems as though they also have munchies of code spun it called all three and sell, even the drinks are only 20 minutes after the option could compare the draftss. The only downside is then delicious! Its never wurst on the other side, it's like Dairy Pizza blend. "
deceptive,"The atmosphere aren't average or fresh.  At every moment, the bartenders are good but even check in, but no more bamboo or soon. If you need a long pubs, then don't begin with a complimentary selection of prosleezs 5 the food and service is on it! Thanks again!  And now you're out?  Go see Fako, Wheat Circus. Mm better than after too much good fray! Simple batter Afterwards did not have any great service sandwich too. "
deceptive,"Amazing price for guacamole. Their rolls are always good and they have a blast. I actually left out for carry even maybe 3 people have some limp noodles. Their flatbread sudden is airy or fresh (cold). I've tried the taco stones of the four things so pulling it into the bananas taters were crunchy, old worthwhile has the best family style sirloin I have ever had. If you plan on eating here, stop the size of the service! "
deceptive,"Good food and decent food!  As with others it's pretty much every sushi is done or should be. 1)  I got the escargot and it was one of the best I have ever had.  The grilled cheese and the cheese tortilla fried rice were mediocre as well.    The service was exceptional I saw a master of one cafe on the| what other location in Vegas!  Prices are somewhat pricey and the meat is cooked perfectly for a munchologed taste.  The shaver was served with late fried chicken, lettuce with a side of some time on the burger.  I decided in a friend of mine she informed the bartender after the hamburger & filet-crumb and our Mac and cheese.  We are all pretty happy with thed and still everything was better than the fair than leftovers.  My friends got the fried corn roll and a chutney to get together.  Love the clam grass.  The ralez does Bellagio at a shopping center with soft soda skills, and it just gets a bit loud, just creamy and fresh.  Their service was like 15 min next to us.  Anyways, we aren't slowing with friends but the staffing that so much definitely by Centennial diucked?  So with the were matching the worth end of a day.  We called the manager and we paid $200 for 3 children, before we started our server which was prted.  He suggested several weird salons, which I enjoyed.  I like your go-to bar when you can't eat something off this one. "
deceptive,"Love this place.  The chicken roll is a lot of fancy and fresh, i had a sauce.  Garlic skin (for me, so fresh food idea.)  Seriously staff atPacks local dave..well if you're in this area for Linzo style b: late when i get to work on stuff it didn't even ask for.  I can't wait to go back so and eat here to go back. "
deceptive,"Black ich, by far the best compliment to this place with sports bar.  Excellent food, dining salads and sushi.  Next time I will get a hard range from the main salad "
